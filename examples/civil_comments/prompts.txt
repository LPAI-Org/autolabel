If Trump wants to totally reinvent the world political and economic order, I think he owes the American public some specific plans and proposed policies. Having "lots of meetings", and telling everyone what a great negotiator he is, is not a plan. The USA is already a great nation with great influence in the world, and we need to honor our long term alliances and commitments, or risk losing much financial and political power and influence. For Pete's sake, we owe these countries trillions of dollars of our national debit. What happens if they ask for their money back?

Having a lot of experience with atheists during my studies in university, and having read works by atheists such as Richard Dawkins, I have never met a single atheist who did not attest that they formulated their atheistic beliefs in relation to their knowledge of science and the scientific method.  When an atheists maintains their position is rational, they mean that they believe their atheistic beliefs are in accord with our contemporary scientific understanding of the universe.  This is hardly a straw man claim and evidence is in abundance.  Find any book written by an atheist that does not tie their beliefs to science and the scientific method.  So, Ariel, is the challenge not then to you to find any evidence to disprove what I state is a clear and undeniable linkage between atheism and contemporary science and methodology?  I could give you a definition of the scientific method if you really want it, but I respect that you have a firm knowledge of this system already.not toxic

Your spins and hyperbolic reactions speak volumes about your attitude on racial issues.

I enjoy your columns a great deal Ms. Moore.  Insanely, enough, I agree with Richard, and it's a bit all over the place.  Regarding loving one's neighbor, however, again I fear you promote a tepid and materialistic perspective of Christian teachings.  The Bible says "God is with us."  Materialists think it means, "God is on our side" (as we fix the world).   It really means, "God is present."      

Jesus was very clear that his kingdom is not of this world until he makes it so.  Christianity is for us, for our inner peace, guidance and direct experience of spirituality.  Through this inner connection we will know the best actions to take when we need to take them - read Paul again.   

Christianity isn't so Christians can "fix" the rest of the world through political organizing, even though that's what a lot of Christians believe. If we truly want to love our enemies, we have to be willing to let the world go exactly as he did.not toxic

Civil discourse has long be absent in Canada, it is nothing new and the left and its allies in the media are just as guilty. The G&M has an almost daily opinion piece that is hurtful to "whites" and would be considered hate speech if aimed at any other segment in society. This hurtful language is bound to stir up extremists on the right. If anyone has a legitimate question, they are shouted down and called "racist"  "denier" "misogynist" "econut"  "leftard" or whatever and not met with rational discourse or rhetorical debate.
Just because I may have  questions regarding the effectiveness and economic cost of the carbon tax does not mean I should be called a "denier" and told to sit down and shut up.
The more the left tells people to sit down and shut up, the more it feeds the extremists.

    Paul: Thank you for your kind words.  I do, indeed, have strong beliefs and don't hide them.  They are based on both facts and values.  I think the question of "bias" and "prejudice" comes into play when we're discussing beliefs and attitudes based on values.  One of our poster friends,  for example, often comments that being "intolerant" of a bias, for example, is, in itself, a bias.  This is, IMO, where the concept of "irratonal antipathy" is important.  If I dislike neo-Nazis because of their views on race, my antipathy is based on fact (knowledge of their views) and values (my belief that condemning others because of their race/religion is WRONG).  Were I to, instead, dislike all Germans, that, IMO, would represent a bias...an irrational antipathy...since not all Germans condemn others because of their race/religion.  I discuss the "bias" question in another response to you....

It's an interesting topic and I'd enjoy discussing it w/you sometime.  Give me a call.  Gary Crum[/INST]

Facts are completely ignored in your thinking, aren't they? The facts.

The Federal Reserve Act was passed in December 1913 and signed by Woodrow Wilson, a democrat. It was passed in the house by a vote of 298 to 60 and in the senate by a vote of 43 to 25. Almost every democrat was in favor of the bill and most republicans opposed the bill. There were three competing versions of the idea with one coming from the republicans called the Aldrich plan. The final bill had some of Aldrich's features but most were from two competing democrat plans. Especially the idea that the Fed be completely controlled by the government. A democratic idea, not republican. The Federal Reserve System was a republican invention? Not hardly. History proves otherwise. There were republican ideas in the final bill but the main bill was and is largely democratic. Maybe we could agree to call it bipartisan with the main tenets of the bill being democratic.not toxic

No reflection against you, Mitchak, because I agree with you in principle.  Just a general rant - "Now if only all people would be reasonable ..."  So, a state income tax would seem to be reasonable?  Along with a sales tax?  And a luxury tax?  An increase in the gas tax?  Eliminating the tax credits?  Taxing the Oilies on the gross, instead of the net?  Cutting 8,000 top and middle management government/U of A jobs?  Eliminating the travel associated with scholastic sports?  No LIO in Spenard, just back to the old fashioned working out of a spare bedroom when not in session?  Table the gas-line for now?  No more "roads/bridges-to-nowhere"?  And etc. and etc.?  Everyone needs to shoulder the burden equally, right?

I see that most everyone's idea of "reasonable" is whatever it takes, just as long as their ox isn't the one getting gored.  Their "reasonable" is what got us into this mess, and it is what is keeping us in this mess, and it is why we never have nice things for very long.not toxic
No new income tax, no raiding the PFD or CBR, no increasing oil taxes until our state government cuts the entire state budget across the board to reflect the state budget of 2006 when oil averaged $80 a barrel. What changes in population, infrastructure or anything else could justify the increase we have seen in state spending of the last ten years. If we followed our state governments logic if oil had reached $200 a barrel the budget today would be in the neighborhood of twelve billion dollars and some change, for what? We would still be driving on the same substandard roads, state school testing would still be at the same level, we would still have the same number of poor and malnourished residents with poor healthcare . I would have no problem if we had a reasonable income tax, our PFD did not pay out earnings to state residents and we had equitable oil and gas taxes. I would just like to see some fiscal responsibility from the people we elect when passing budget legislation.not toxic

    Let’s see if I understand this; Berkowitz announces a $14M surplus then he rails against Proposition 8 because it would constrain his ability to confiscate even more money from citizens. Berkowitz and his allies on the Assembly changed the tax cap language to facilitate confiscating greater amounts of citizen’s money. Now why would a mayor who professes fidelity with the taxpayers change the law to enable him to take more money from them? Probably because he plans to take more money from them.  Berkowitz said if Proposition 8 passes “it severely constrains our ability to give out property tax relief.”  So Berkowitz wants the ability to confiscate more of the citizen’s money to provide property relief. How about taking less of that money in the first place?  Let’s hope Proposition 8 passes.[/INST]

First of all, 16 months to introduce this legislation isn't a rush, you should be asking what's taking so long. It's not a complicated problem no matter what some people say, there are numerous jurisdictions including several US states we can copy from. 

"To legalize it to make it harder for young people to acquire the drug seems counterintuitive. "
Of course it is - that is NOT the purpose. We are NOT legalizing to make it harder to get, we're legalizing because prohibition and criminalization are stupid, inefficient, expensive, unjustifiable policies. 

"This is all about "revenue generation" trumping public safety."
No, it's not, because there's no public safety issue to speak of, and if they were sacrificing it for revenue generation this would have been in place long before the budget instead of afterward. On the contrary, your attempt to label it as nothing more than revenue generation is not only wrong but partisan fakery to distract from policy.not toxic

No reflection against you, Mitchak, because I agree with you in principle.  Just a general rant - "Now if only all people would be reasonable ..."  So, a state income tax would seem to be reasonable?  Along with a sales tax?  And a luxury tax?  An increase in the gas tax?  Eliminating the tax credits?  Taxing the Oilies on the gross, instead of the net?  Cutting 8,000 top and middle management government/U of A jobs?  Eliminating the travel associated with scholastic sports?  No LIO in Spenard, just back to the old fashioned working out of a spare bedroom when not in session?  Table the gas-line for now?  No more "roads/bridges-to-nowhere"?  And etc. and etc.?  Everyone needs to shoulder the burden equally, right?

"Trump led Republican party"?  

The Republican party who was willing to take Cruz to avoid Trump"

The Republican Party that spent millions of dollars to go for anyone but Trump?

If the Republican Party was 'following' Trump, there would already be a 'Repeal and Replace"; there isn't.

If the Republican Party was 'following' Trump,there would already be a Congressional Bill on DACA; there isn't.

Trump is no more a Republican leading other Republicans than Sanders is a Democrat leading other Democrats!

First of all, no company likes to lose orders, no matter the size.  Second, I think you fail to see that this is far more than money, this is about relationships and branding. Canadian is known worldwide, to be America's closest partner, so the world is watching our business relations closely to learn what to expect in their own relations.  In playing along with Washington's current protectionist attitude towards trade, Boeing has shown the world (esp. NATO members) that they may not be the best partner for future procurement projects and that they may be moving more of their production home (America first) in the near future. As such, they could have seriously damaged their brand and their global bottom line long term.  Airbus and European military aircraft manufacturers have a great opportunity and should seize it now.not toxic
Siemens is sick and tired of Canadian politicians interfering in their rail business.

Canada needs to stop the influx of refugees, look after the interests of Canadians first and cooperate with the United States of America and its president.

Are we really so naive to believe that if the PM would have had the intention of doing a favor to an old friend a free helicopter ride was the thing that had him made it.?  It is pure witch hunt and then we are surprised why the best do not show up for public service. Would any of us have his/her own life thrown apart for a bunch of whiners never happy wanting everything without paying for anything. I am paying probably more taxes than I would like but I am happy and proud to live in a country that is protecting the weakest. This is insane we have completely lost a real perspective.

During all of these discussions about the budget crisis in Alaska, Walker and the legislature have allowed the oil companies to go unaudited.  

The few audits that were completed should have brought the state $488 Million but the state is not bothering to collect on it.

"The first wave of net tax audits from 2006 and 2007— completed from five to nearly six years later — resulted in $488 million in additional tax assessments. But whether the money will be collected "is unknown at this time"

He was taken overseas when he was nine or ten- he was taken prisoner, refused a trial, and sent to Guantanamo .
That is why he was 'out of the country"; he had no choice.
There is a huge distinstion between children who are taken away and brainwashed, and adults who willingly leave the counrty to fight against it.
There is no legal reason for the widow of the man killed, and the other person injured, to sue  in another country. There was no proper trial, and the 'confession" was the only way he could get out of Guantanamo and back to prison in Canada.

I enjoy your columns a great deal Ms. Moore.  Insanely, enough, I agree with Richard, and it's a bit all over the place.  Regarding loving one's neighbor, however, again I fear you promote a tepid and materialistic perspective of Christian teachings.  The Bible says "God is with us."  Materialists think it means, "God is on our side" (as we fix the world).   It really means, "God is present."      

Jesus was very clear that his kingdom is not of this world until he makes it so.  Christianity is for us, for our inner peace, guidance and direct experience of spirituality.  Through this inner connection we will know the best actions to take when we need to take them - read Paul again.   

Christianity isn't so Christians can "fix" the rest of the world through political organizing, even though that's what a lot of Christians believe. If we truly want to love our enemies, we have to be willing to let the world go exactly as he did.not toxic

Headline: Lamar Winston planning to make his first start on defense for Oregon Ducks at Wyoming

Article: Leavitt said he’s not sure if Winston will open the game against the Cowboys. “We have different personnel groups so I don’t know if he’ll start or not, it depends on who goes out there,” he said.

From the article it appears the defense in an ongoing state of competition and we can expect, injuries aside, to see different people inserted as starters based on practice performances.

Mr. Wright, sometimes the "ivory tower" intellectual lacks practical experience.

I received a few months ago a pamphlet from a (no doubt) wise, learned and good intentioned professor advising me on the best way to raise baby chicks (I've been in the business all my life).  I dutifully read the pamphlet and ended up annoyed.

He gave advice on heating the barns (I respectfully submit I know more about my barns than the gentleman) - some the way I do things, some the way I don't for various reasons.  Some not unreasonable advice on feed and water.

The good doctor also made some downright screwy suggestions like checking the rectal temperature of a representative sample of 20 - 50 chicks per floor per day - a pointless waste of time not to mention an undesirable way to spend it.

Civil discourse has long be absent in Canada, it is nothing new and the left and its allies in the media are just as guilty.

No reflection against you, Mitchak, because I agree with you in principle.  Just a general rant - "Now if only all people would be reasonable ..."  So, a state income tax would seem to be reasonable?  Along with a sales tax?  And a luxury tax?  An increase in the gas tax?  Eliminating the tax credits?  Taxing the Oilies on the gross, instead of the net?  Cutting 8,000 top and middle management government/U of A jobs?  Eliminating the travel associated with scholastic sports?  No LIO in Spenard, just back to the old fashioned working out of a spare bedroom when not in session?  Table the gas-line for now?  No more "roads/bridges-to-nowhere"?  And etc. and etc.?  Everyone needs to shoulder the burden equally, right?

I see that most everyone's idea of "reasonable" is whatever it takes, just as long as their ox isn't the one getting gored.  Their "reasonable" is what got us into this mess, and it is what is keeping us in this mess, and it is why we never have nice things for very long.not toxic
No new income tax, no raiding the PFD or CBR, no increasing oil taxes until our state government cuts the entire state budget across the board to reflect the state budget of 2006 when oil averaged $80 a barrel. What changes in population, infrastructure or anything else could justify the increase we have seen in state spending of the last ten years. If we followed our state governments logic if oil had reached $200 a barrel the budget today would be in the neighborhood of twelve billion dollars and some change, for what? We would still be driving on the same substandard roads, state school testing would still be at the same level, we would still have the same number of poor and malnourished residents with poor healthcare . I would have no problem if we had a reasonable income tax, our PFD did not pay out earnings to state residents and we had equitable oil and gas taxes. I would just like to see some fiscal responsibility from the people we elect when passing budget legislation.not toxic
For the most part I agree with Bob. I'll go one step further and add that an income tax should be considered only after the permanent fund dividend is stopped. Taxing income earners in order to pay a dividend is an abusive form of socialism.

Paying a dividend to people who don't need it while taxing their income is perverse.not toxic

No new income tax, no raiding the PFD or CBR, no increasing oil taxes until our state government cuts the entire state budget across the board to reflect the state budget of 2006 when oil averaged $80 a barrel. What changes in population, infrastructure or anything else could justify the increase we have seen in state spending of the last ten years.

No reflection against you, Mitchak, because I agree with you in principle.  Just a general rant - "Now if only all people would be reasonable ..."

The only thing stopping you from Googling it up and reading about it is your intense desire to remain ignorant of facts you don't like. Reagan won every Southern state except Georgia in 1980. Jimmy Carter was Georgia's Favorite Son.

The important thing is that the "Solid South" is now solidly Republican. In spite of your meaningless citation of a dozen dead people, the South has changed little in political and social character, still being the center of black voter discouragement, disenfranchisement, and gerrymandering. Only a few states are "solid" Democratic states, by contrast; the "flyover states" are mostly firmly Republican, and the "rust belt states" are in contention. Southern voters and politician are the same as always except that now they call themselves "Republican". And without the South, Republicans could not win the presidency any more.[/INST]

    Where are all the Catholic schools in Chicago?  Why were they not supported and continue to thrive.  Do you think the demographics had something to do with it.  People whose children  went to these schools mostly for free or greatly reduced rates and the same parents who did not contribute in the Sunday basket brought about the destruction of the school system that only survives in the suburbs.  Do you really want this to happen to the rest on the nation with everything you touch, see or taste.  Woman, you have no clue.[/INST]

    As the Minister of Information and Policy and Strategy advisor to the Hawaiian Kingdom I can state unequivocally and with full authority that the "aquarium industry" is in violation of one of the basic principles of Hawaiian culture, malama aina.

Malama aina has been a traditional socio-cultural practice of Hawaiians and ALL Polynesian peoples for many many thousands of years. Malama aina roughly translates as "nurture and sustain what feeds and provides for us". It means that we must act ethically, sustainably and on a subsistence basis at ALL times whenever we take food or resources from nature,

To do this we take from nature only what we need to sustain ourselves and NOTHING more and we do nothing that might effect the natural balance of all living things.

The "aquarium industry" violates this basic Hawaiian principle because it takes reef fish for monetary profit NOT for subsistence.

Civil discourse has long be absent in Canada, it is nothing new and the left and its allies in the media are just as guilty. The G&M has an almost daily opinion piece that is hurtful to "whites" and would be considered hate speech if aimed at any other segment in society. This hurtful language is bound to stir up extremists on the right. If anyone has a legitimate question, they are shouted down and called "racist"  "denier" "misogynist" "econut"  "leftard" or whatever and not met with rational discourse or rhetorical debate.

    That's an apples and oranges comparison. The carbon tax is not an environmental issue but a political issue. If Canada were to completely stop using carbon, the global impact would be statistically insignificant. Night hunting and wildlife conservation on the other hand is an environmental issue that I am sure if everyone put politics aside, they would come to some sort of bipartisan agreement.

I enjoy your columns a great deal Ms. Moore.  Insanely, enough, I agree with Richard, and it's a bit all over the place.  Regarding loving one's neighbor, however, again I fear you promote a tepid and materialistic perspective of Christian teachings.  The Bible says "God is with us."  Materialists think it means, "God is on our side" (as we fix the world).   It really means, "God is present."      

Jesus was very clear that his kingdom is not of this world until he makes it so.  Christianity is for us, for our inner peace, guidance and direct experience of spirituality.  Through this inner connection we will know the best actions to take when we need to take them - read Paul again.

    An old professor once told me "Never mistake ritual for reality." The Church evolved into a community dependent on priests because of its attachment to rituals, some of them weekly. If the Church were to consider that rituals are necessary less frequently -- or not at all -- the idea of a "priest shortage" would have to be revisited.

    This is an appalling decision in allowing the takeover of a high tech firm by businesses linked to the communist party of China, which has never renounced its' ideological commitment to combat, undermine, and destroy, western capitalism, individual rights, right of ownership, expression of differing opinion, and democratic election.  This is a country that has corrupted and bullied governances in Asia and Africa to exert their sphere of influence.  It is a regime that has brutally oppressed its' own population since assuming power in 1948.  It is a stain on the 6000 year old civilization of China.

One can only wonder whether this decision is linked to the pay for access scandal and recent contributions to the Trudeau Foundation by those affiliated with the communist regime.

No reflection against you, Mitchak, because I agree with you in principle.  Just a general rant - "Now if only all people would be reasonable ..."  So, a state income tax would seem to be reasonable?  Along with a sales tax?  And a luxury tax?  An increase in the gas tax?  Eliminating the tax credits?  Taxing the Oilies on the gross, instead of the net?  Cutting 8,000 top and middle management government/U of A jobs?  Eliminating the travel associated with scholastic sports?  No LIO in Spenard, just back to the old fashioned working out of a spare bedroom when not in session?  Table the gas-line for now?  No more "roads/bridges-to-nowhere"?  And etc. and etc.?

I see that most everyone's idea of "reasonable" is whatever it takes, just as long as their ox isn't the one getting gored.  Their "reasonable" is what got us into this mess, and it is what is keeping us in this mess, and it is why we never have nice things for very long.not toxic

Kenneth Baitsholts - Perhaps you don't realize this, but almost a 1000 years after its founding, England still has no written constitution. Neither does Canada or New Zealand. This does not mean they don't have rules by which they govern that they hold to under most circumstances, but that -- for whatever reason -- they don't see a reason to write them down in a single document. They spread their governance rules out through acts of Parliament, etc.

Don't get me wrong. I think constitutions are a good thing, but it's really not a good argument against Israel, that they don't have a single written constitution. They have a operative one based on their Declaration of Establishment.

Just how closely does the US Constitution and the government that has grown from it reflect the Founding principles of our nation?

    States rights and white supremacy are not mutually exclusive. The state right that was being defended was the right to enslave black people for fun and profit. Today many states want the right to treat certain members of our nation as 2nd class citizens. For example, men can have what ever kind of healthcare they think they need. Their only limitation is whether or not they can afford the health care they want. Women don't have that right in many states. Another  right that is not the same for all Americans is the right to own guns under the 2nd Amendment. Our white domestic terrorists are allowed to walk around in public armed while black people are killed for the mere suspicion of being armed. The United States are not that united. We clearly don't share the same morality from state to state. The truth is all lives don't matter here. They never have. We will never be united until we make all lives matter.[/INST]

For the most part I agree with Bob. I'll go one step further and add that an income tax should be considered only after the permanent fund dividend is stopped. Taxing income earners in order to pay a dividend is an abusive form of socialism.

    Alaska currently pays out more and takes less in from oil companies than any time in it's history.  Huge cuts in the oil production tax, not declining oil prices are responsible for the bulk of the deficit.  A fact that very few people understand. If the oil and gas industry paid its fair share the deficit would be 50-75% solved.  A modest progressive income tax would be all we need to fill the gap.  Protect the PFD.

If 5 people hold a rally against a pipeline our media falls over itself trying to mainstream the protesters, though they represent an extreme view. The lesson to the right is "be extreme" or be ignorednot toxic

Why blame gas/oil on every mistake?  When you get a hold of some cash...here comes over spending again. Just like our Native Corp...the price of Zinc has been $1.00+ a pound for a year which is high compared to the usual .55 cents for ten years. And yet shareholders received another letter blaming the price of zinc. I'm happy Don Young was successful in passing the bill to allow all Native Viet Nam vets a chance to apply for land.

I enjoy your columns a great deal Ms. Moore.  Insanely, enough, I agree with Richard, and it's a bit all over the place.  Regarding loving one's neighbor, however, again I fear you promote a tepid and materialistic perspective of Christian teachings.  The Bible says "God is with us."  Materialists think it means, "God is on our side" (as we fix the world).   It really means, "God is present."      

Jesus was very clear that his kingdom is not of this world until he makes it so.  Christianity is for us, for our inner peace, guidance and direct experience of spirituality.  Through this inner connection we will know the best actions to take when we need to take them - read Paul again.   

Christianity isn't so Christians can "fix" the rest of the world through political organizing, even though that's what a lot of Christians believe. If we truly want to love our enemies, we have to be willing to let the world go exactly as he did.not toxic

The best thing to happen to the United States has been the election of Trump, just like when Lokelani Lindsey was appointed Bishop Estate Trustee, it exposes all the corruption and self-serving policies of the people that are willing to sacrifice the many for their own gain.not toxic

PRESIDENT Trump received a lot of support NOT because of media cheerleading and so-called nationalism. The fake “news” media hate Trump and will do all in their power to use lies and distortions to bring him down. As for nationalism, that is far too narrow an explanation. People both at home and abroad suddenly realized we have a patriot in the White House who does not invent fake “red lines” and act like a braggart while doing nothing to back up all his big talk. Unlike his predecessor, Trump is a REAL executive and for him action talks and BS walks.

    Paul: Thank you for your kind words.  I do, indeed, have strong beliefs and don't hide them.  They are based on both facts and values.  I think the question of "bias" and "prejudice" comes into play when we're discussing beliefs and attitudes based on values.  One of our poster friends,  for example, often comments that being "intolerant" of a bias, for example, is, in itself, a bias.  This is, IMO, where the concept of "irratonal antipathy" is important.  If I dislike neo-Nazis because of their views on race, my antipathy is based on fact (knowledge of their views) and values (my belief that condemning others because of their race/religion is WRONG).  Were I to, instead, dislike all Germans, that, IMO, would represent a bias...an irrational antipathy...since not all Germans condemn others because of their race/religion.  I discuss the "bias" question in another response to you....

It's an interesting topic and I'd enjoy discussing it w/you sometime.  Give me a call.  Gary Crum[/INST]

    Let’s see if I understand this; Berkowitz announces a $14M surplus then he rails against Proposition 8 because it would constrain his ability to confiscate even more money from citizens. Berkowitz and his allies on the Assembly changed the tax cap language to facilitate confiscating greater amounts of citizen’s money. Now why would a mayor who professes fidelity with the taxpayers change the law to enable him to take more money from them? Probably because he plans to take more money from them.  Berkowitz said if Proposition 8 passes “it severely constrains our ability to give out property tax relief.”  So Berkowitz wants the ability to confiscate more of the citizen’s money to provide property relief. How about taking less of that money in the first place?  Let’s hope Proposition 8 passes.[/INST]

    Between racist Eastman and 'Slappy' Wilson the Wasilla delegation is an embarassment to the valley and the State. Both should resign. This is Trump's America, open racism in the Republican party and physical attacks on reporters.

The self-pitying ones with their myriad complaints would have you believe that Canada is a dreadful place to live -- why they haven't left for their perfect foreign paradise is a mystery -- when by any relative standard it remains a refuge of stability in a chaotic world, its ongoing issues not likely to be solved by endless griping from anonymous online cranks.[/INST]

    Well here we go again.  Let's continue to subsidize the cost of power, costs that are out of control due to decisions made by the Liberal government.  How nice to know the government has such contempt for the citizens of Ontario that it thinks we won't understand we are being bribed with out own tax dollars - tax dollars we will have to pay back with interest - to make re-election of these corrupt fools possible.  Not enough that the deficit remains large, we will now increase that deficit to buy votes.  This stinks, just like the power plant cancellation last election.  Ontario voters, wake up and throw these bums out!![/INST]

    I believe we have reached any reasonable limit of decency in interfering with the private life of our politicians. Are we really so naive to believe that if the PM would have had the intention of doing a favor to an old friend a free helicopter ride was the thing that had him made it.?  It is pure witch hunt and then we are surprised why the best do not show up for public service. Would any of us have his/her own life thrown apart for a bunch of whiners never happy wanting everything without paying for anything. I am paying probably more taxes than I would like but I am happy and proud to live in a country that is protecting the weakest. This is insane we have completely lost a real perspective. This is not the measurement of the success of a politician, if he takes a free helicopter ride. But unfortunately it is much easier to blame someone else than look at yourself and be honest about our shortcomings. Who is without sin throw the first stone[/INST]

    The headline does not correspond with the content in the article and specifically to what Coach Leavitt has to say on the matter.

Headline: Lamar Winston planning to make his first start on defense for Oregon Ducks at Wyoming

Article: Leavitt said he’s not sure if Winston will open the game against the Cowboys. “We have different personnel groups so I don’t know if he’ll start or not, it depends on who goes out there,” he said.

From the article it appears the defense in an ongoing state of competition and we can expect, injuries aside, to see different people inserted as starters based on practice performances.

    Just because in the past people's mental health was disregarded, doesn't mean that it was right. From my experiences and observations, it created a generation of adults who are miserable and unable to deal with their emotions or admit when they are in need of help.

    All the folks you mention are dead. The Southern Strategy was real and deliberate. The only thing stopping you from Googling it up and reading about it is your intense desire to remain ignorant of facts you don't like. Reagan won every Southern state except Georgia in 1980. Jimmy Carter was Georgia's Favorite Son.

The important thing is that the "Solid South" is now solidly Republican. In spite of your meaningless citation of a dozen dead people, the South has changed little in political and social character, still being the center of black voter discouragement, disenfranchisement, and gerrymandering. Only a few states are "solid" Democratic states, by contrast; the "flyover states" are mostly firmly Republican, and the "rust belt states" are in contention. Southern voters and politician are the same as always except that now they call themselves "Republican". And without the South, Republicans could not win the presidency any more.[/INST]

    One point of note with regards to Australia's minimum wage: Tipping is all but unheard of there.  So those working in restaurants or bars might get a higher "wage" but little to no tips, so their overall wage is comparable.

Obvious restaurants and bars aren't the only ones that pay low wages, but they are one of the big industries paying lower wages here.

Also prices in Australia are quite a bit higher than in Canada.  OECD puts the Purchasing Power Parity comparison at roughly 16% higher, so $17.60 Aussie dollars is more like $15 Canadian dollars from a PPP perspective.[/INST]

    Where are all the Catholic schools in Chicago?  Why were they not supported and continue to thrive.  Do you think the demographics had something to do with it.  People whose children  went to these schools mostly for free or greatly reduced rates and the same parents who did not contribute in the Sunday basket brought about the destruction of the school system that only survives in the suburbs.  Do you really want this to happen to the rest on the nation with everything you touch, see or taste.  Woman, you have no clue.[/INST]

    As the Minister of Information and Policy and Strategy advisor to the Hawaiian Kingdom I can state unequivocally and with full authority that the "aquarium industry" is in violation of one of the basic principles of Hawaiian culture, malama aina.

Malama aina has been a traditional socio-cultural practice of Hawaiians and ALL Polynesian peoples for many many thousands of years. Malama aina roughly translates as "nurture and sustain what feeds and provides for us". It means that we must act ethically, sustainably and on a subsistence basis at ALL times whenever we take food or resources from nature,

To do this we take from nature only what we need to sustain ourselves and NOTHING more and we do nothing that might effect the natural balance of all living things.

The "aquarium industry" violates this basic Hawaiian principle because it takes reef fish for monetary profit NOT for subsistence.

    That's an apples and oranges comparison. The carbon tax is not an environmental issue but a political issue. If Canada were to completely stop using carbon, the global impact would be statistically insignificant. Night hunting and wildlife conservation on the other hand is an environmental issue that I am sure if everyone put politics aside, they would come to some sort of bipartisan agreement. It would be nice if these chiefs for once, took responsibility and did their job but it's obvious that their intentions run counter to the rest of the population, including their own.[/INST]

    An old professor once told me "Never mistake ritual for reality." The Church evolved into a community dependent on priests because of its attachment to rituals, some of them weekly. If the Church were to consider that rituals are necessary less frequently -- or not at all -- the idea of a "priest shortage" would have to be revisited. 
The reality of the gospel is attainable by anyone who puts it into practice in their lives. We don't need more priests. We need Catholics who take charge of their faith.[/INST]

    This is an appalling decision in allowing the takeover of a high tech firm by businesses linked to the communist party of China, which has never renounced its' ideological commitment to combat, undermine, and destroy, western capitalism, individual rights, right of ownership, expression of differing opinion, and democratic election.  This is a country that has corrupted and bullied governances in Asia and Africa to exert their sphere of influence.  It is a regime that has brutally oppressed its' own population since assuming power in 1948.  It is a stain on the 6000 year old civilization of China.

One can only wonder whether this decision is linked to the pay for access scandal and recent contributions to the Trudeau Foundation by those affiliated with the communist regime.

We, as a nation, and critical component of western defence and democracy, must prevent this breach of  western security.  Our allies must be outraged.  A thorough investigation of this decision is required.[/INST]

    This is a perfect example of why you will not be talking to anyone but yourself. Lack of comprehension skills. There is no point discussing with you. Doesn't matter what science is cited, you guys say it is bad, pseudo science or irrelevant. There is just no point when you consider youselves smarter than the entire EU Public Health Panel on Biocides and also their Fluoridation Panel. 
Must be nice to be so much smarter than everyone else. Pity your opinion is irrelevant to them. 
Read the letters from the various health authorities in Europe on fluoridation. Don't even try that assertion that the question was loaded. An answer that says fluoridation is not wanted, needed or in some cases not permitted, does not come from a loaded question. Now you know why your opinion is neither wanted, needed (except to laugh at) and considered superfluous. 
Please do not bother answering. We have real matters to take care of, Like kicking Fluoridation out of our community forever.[/INST]

    Another great 'Vicky article'. Love them!
I grew up on a homestead in the Copper River Valley. Now that gets cold! I spent hours outdoors, skating, mushing dogs, getting wood, hunting, you name it. Never froze a single finger or toe or was even uncomfortable. The secret? Ahtna-made moose hide mukluks and mitts. No lie: 50 and 60 below and never got cold once. I put thick wool felt insoles in the mukluks and wore thinner mittens inside the moose-mitts and that did the trick. Hey, it worked for the Ahtna people for thousands of years. And if you want to keep your toes warm indoors all winter get a pair of moosehide moccasin slippers. The hand made ones with beaver fur around the tops.[/INST]

    States rights and white supremacy are not mutually exclusive. The state right that was being defended was the right to enslave black people for fun and profit. Today many states want the right to treat certain members of our nation as 2nd class citizens. For example, men can have what ever kind of healthcare they think they need. Their only limitation is whether or not they can afford the health care they want. Women don't have that right in many states. Another  right that is not the same for all Americans is the right to own guns under the 2nd Amendment. Our white domestic terrorists are allowed to walk around in public armed while black people are killed for the mere suspicion of being armed. The United States are not that united. We clearly don't share the same morality from state to state. The truth is all lives don't matter here. They never have. We will never be united until we make all lives matter.[/INST]

    Only in America can you get 25 likes for admitting you are pathetic. But seriously financial destitution is a pretty common thing in a state where booms and busts happen with great regularity. The weird thing is an occasional bust might not be such a bad thing, If Alaska became the "Land of Milk and Honey"
everyone would want to live here. A huge influx of people would slowly destroy the wilderness that keeps many of us here. But perhaps more importantly with the pressures bust's produce comes innovation and a role up your sleeves attitude which often leads to prosperity of the soul if not the pocketbook. The pathetic thing is when people get too comfortable they get lazy and complacent. This can happen to individuals and even to the things humans create like pipelines, legislative bodies or permanent funds. We live in chaotic times but we might end up better for it with some time out to think.[/INST]

    Alaska currently pays out more and takes less in from oil companies than any time in it's history.  Huge cuts in the oil production tax, not declining oil prices are responsible for the bulk of the deficit.  A fact that very few people understand. If the oil and gas industry paid its fair share the deficit would be 50-75% solved.  A modest progressive income tax would be all we need to fill the gap.  Protect the PFD.  As ownership state shareholders, it's the people's return on their investment that keeps us connected to our great land.[/INST]

    Paul: Thank you for your kind words.  I do, indeed, have strong beliefs and don't hide them.  They are based on both facts and values.  I think the question of "bias" and "prejudice" comes into play when we're discussing beliefs and attitudes based on values.  One of our poster friends,  for example, often comments that being "intolerant" of a bias, for example, is, in itself, a bias.  This is, IMO, where the concept of "irratonal antipathy" is important.  If I dislike neo-Nazis because of their views on race, my antipathy is based on fact (knowledge of their views) and values (my belief that condemning others because of their race/religion is WRONG).  Were I to, instead, dislike all Germans, that, IMO, would represent a bias...an irrational antipathy...since not all Germans condemn others because of their race/religion.  I discuss the "bias" question in another response to you....

It's an interesting topic and I'd enjoy discussing it w/you sometime.  Give me a call.  Gary Crum[/INST]

    Let’s see if I understand this; Berkowitz announces a $14M surplus then he rails against Proposition 8 because it would constrain his ability to confiscate even more money from citizens. Berkowitz and his allies on the Assembly changed the tax cap language to facilitate confiscating greater amounts of citizen’s money. Now why would a mayor who professes fidelity with the taxpayers change the law to enable him to take more money from them? Probably because he plans to take more money from them.  Berkowitz said if Proposition 8 passes “it severely constrains our ability to give out property tax relief.”  So Berkowitz wants the ability to confiscate more of the citizen’s money to provide property relief. How about taking less of that money in the first place?  Let’s hope Proposition 8 passes.[/INST]

Thank you for telling us about this.[/INST]

    Well here we go again.  Let's continue to subsidize the cost of power, costs that are out of control due to decisions made by the Liberal government.  How nice to know the government has such contempt for the citizens of Ontario that it thinks we won't understand we are being bribed with out own tax dollars - tax dollars we will have to pay back with interest - to make re-election of these corrupt fools possible.  Not enough that the deficit remains large, we will now increase that deficit to buy votes.  This stinks, just like the power plant cancellation last election.  Ontario voters, wake up and throw these bums out!![/INST]

    I believe we have reached any reasonable limit of decency in interfering with the private life of our politicians. Are we really so naive to believe that if the PM would have had the intention of doing a favor to an old friend a free helicopter ride was the thing that had him made it.?  It is pure witch hunt and then we are surprised why the best do not show up for public service. Would any of us have his/her own life thrown apart for a bunch of whiners never happy wanting everything without paying for anything. I am paying probably more taxes than I would like but I am happy and proud to live in a country that is protecting the weakest. This is insane we have completely lost a real perspective. This is not the measurement of the success of a politician, if he takes a free helicopter ride. But unfortunately it is much easier to blame someone else than look at yourself and be honest about our shortcomings. Who is without sin throw the first stone[/INST]

    The headline does not correspond with the content in the article and specifically to what Coach Leavitt has to say on the matter.

Headline: Lamar Winston planning to make his first start on defense for Oregon Ducks at Wyoming

Article: Leavitt said he’s not sure if Winston will open the game against the Cowboys. “We have different personnel groups so I don’t know if he’ll start or not, it depends on who goes out there,” he said.

From the article it appears the defense in an ongoing state of competition and we can expect, injuries aside, to see different people inserted as starters based on practice performances.

From my experiences and observations, it created a generation of adults who are miserable and unable to deal with their emotions or admit when they are in need of help.

    All the folks you mention are dead. The Southern Strategy was real and deliberate. The only thing stopping you from Googling it up and reading about it is your intense desire to remain ignorant of facts you don't like. Reagan won every Southern state except Georgia in 1980. Jimmy Carter was Georgia's Favorite Son.

The important thing is that the "Solid South" is now solidly Republican. In spite of your meaningless citation of a dozen dead people, the South has changed little in political and social character, still being the center of black voter discouragement, disenfranchisement, and gerrymandering. Only a few states are "solid" Democratic states, by contrast; the "flyover states" are mostly firmly Republican, and the "rust belt states" are in contention. Southern voters and politician are the same as always except that now they call themselves "Republican". And without the South, Republicans could not win the presidency any more.[/INST]

    One point of note with regards to Australia's minimum wage: Tipping is all but unheard of there.  So those working in restaurants or bars might get a higher "wage" but little to no tips, so their overall wage is comparable.

Obvious restaurants and bars aren't the only ones that pay low wages, but they are one of the big industries paying lower wages here.

Also prices in Australia are quite a bit higher than in Canada.  OECD puts the Purchasing Power Parity comparison at roughly 16% higher, so $17.60 Aussie dollars is more like $15 Canadian dollars from a PPP perspective.[/INST]

    As the Minister of Information and Policy and Strategy advisor to the Hawaiian Kingdom I can state unequivocally and with full authority that the "aquarium industry" is in violation of one of the basic principles of Hawaiian culture, malama aina.

Malama aina has been a traditional socio-cultural practice of Hawaiians and ALL Polynesian peoples for many many thousands of years. Malama aina roughly translates as "nurture and sustain what feeds and provides for us". It means that we must act ethically, sustainably and on a subsistence basis at ALL times whenever we take food or resources from nature,

To do this we take from nature only what we need to sustain ourselves and NOTHING more and we do nothing that might effect the natural balance of all living things.

The "aquarium industry" violates this basic Hawaiian principle because it takes reef fish for monetary profit NOT for subsistence.

    That's an apples and oranges comparison. The carbon tax is not an environmental issue but a political issue. If Canada were to completely stop using carbon, the global impact would be statistically insignificant. Night hunting and wildlife conservation on the other hand is an environmental issue that I am sure if everyone put politics aside, they would come to some sort of bipartisan agreement. It would be nice if these chiefs for once, took responsibility and did their job but it's obvious that their intentions run counter to the rest of the population, including their own.[/INST]

    An old professor once told me "Never mistake ritual for reality." The Church evolved into a community dependent on priests because of its attachment to rituals, some of them weekly. If the Church were to consider that rituals are necessary less frequently -- or not at all -- the idea of a "priest shortage" would have to be revisited. 
The reality of the gospel is attainable by anyone who puts it into practice in their lives. We don't need more priests. We need Catholics who take charge of their faith.[/INST]

    This is an appalling decision in allowing the takeover of a high tech firm by businesses linked to the communist party of China, which has never renounced its' ideological commitment to combat, undermine, and destroy, western capitalism, individual rights, right of ownership, expression of differing opinion, and democratic election.  This is a country that has corrupted and bullied governances in Asia and Africa to exert their sphere of influence.  It is a regime that has brutally oppressed its' own population since assuming power in 1948.  It is a stain on the 6000 year old civilization of China.

One can only wonder whether this decision is linked to the pay for access scandal and recent contributions to the Trudeau Foundation by those affiliated with the communist regime.

We, as a nation, and critical component of western defence and democracy, must prevent this breach of  western security.  Our allies must be outraged.  A thorough investigation of this decision is required.[/INST]

    This is a perfect example of why you will not be talking to anyone but yourself. Lack of comprehension skills. There is no point discussing with you. Doesn't matter what science is cited, you guys say it is bad, pseudo science or irrelevant. There is just no point when you consider youselves smarter than the entire EU Public Health Panel on Biocides and also their Fluoridation Panel. 
Must be nice to be so much smarter than everyone else. Pity your opinion is irrelevant to them. 
Read the letters from the various health authorities in Europe on fluoridation. Don't even try that assertion that the question was loaded. An answer that says fluoridation is not wanted, needed or in some cases not permitted, does not come from a loaded question. Now you know why your opinion is neither wanted, needed (except to laugh at) and considered superfluous. 
Please do not bother answering. We have real matters to take care of, Like kicking Fluoridation out of our community forever.[/INST]

    Another great 'Vicky article'. Love them!
I grew up on a homestead in the Copper River Valley. Now that gets cold! I spent hours outdoors, skating, mushing dogs, getting wood, hunting, you name it. Never froze a single finger or toe or was even uncomfortable. The secret? Ahtna-made moose hide mukluks and mitts. No lie: 50 and 60 below and never got cold once. I put thick wool felt insoles in the mukluks and wore thinner mittens inside the moose-mitts and that did the trick. Hey, it worked for the Ahtna people for thousands of years. And if you want to keep your toes warm indoors all winter get a pair of moosehide moccasin slippers. The hand made ones with beaver fur around the tops.[/INST]

This is necessary also to fund Medicaid expansion where a single able bodied person can choose NOT to work and get free health care.

    States rights and white supremacy are not mutually exclusive. The state right that was being defended was the right to enslave black people for fun and profit. Today many states want the right to treat certain members of our nation as 2nd class citizens. For example, men can have what ever kind of healthcare they think they need. Their only limitation is whether or not they can afford the health care they want. Women don't have that right in many states. Another  right that is not the same for all Americans is the right to own guns under the 2nd Amendment. Our white domestic terrorists are allowed to walk around in public armed while black people are killed for the mere suspicion of being armed. The United States are not that united. We clearly don't share the same morality from state to state. The truth is all lives don't matter here. They never have. We will never be united until we make all lives matter.[/INST]

    Only in America can you get 25 likes for admitting you are pathetic. But seriously financial destitution is a pretty common thing in a state where booms and busts happen with great regularity. The weird thing is an occasional bust might not be such a bad thing, If Alaska became the "Land of Milk and Honey"
everyone would want to live here. A huge influx of people would slowly destroy the wilderness that keeps many of us here. But perhaps more importantly with the pressures bust's produce comes innovation and a role up your sleeves attitude which often leads to prosperity of the soul if not the pocketbook. The pathetic thing is when people get too comfortable they get lazy and complacent. This can happen to individuals and even to the things humans create like pipelines, legislative bodies or permanent funds. We live in chaotic times but we might end up better for it with some time out to think.[/INST]

    Alaska currently pays out more and takes less in from oil companies than any time in it's history.  Huge cuts in the oil production tax, not declining oil prices are responsible for the bulk of the deficit.  A fact that very few people understand. If the oil and gas industry paid its fair share the deficit would be 50-75% solved.  A modest progressive income tax would be all we need to fill the gap.  Protect the PFD.  As ownership state shareholders, it's the people's return on their investment that keeps us connected to our great land.[/INST]

    Paul: Thank you for your kind words.  I do, indeed, have strong beliefs and don't hide them.  They are based on both facts and values.  I think the question of "bias" and "prejudice" comes into play when we're discussing beliefs and attitudes based on values.  One of our poster friends,  for example, often comments that being "intolerant" of a bias, for example, is, in itself, a bias.  This is, IMO, where the concept of "irratonal antipathy" is important.  If I dislike neo-Nazis because of their views on race, my antipathy is based on fact (knowledge of their views) and values (my belief that condemning others because of their race/religion is WRONG).  Were I to, instead, dislike all Germans, that, IMO, would represent a bias...an irrational antipathy...since not all Germans condemn others because of their race/religion.  I discuss the "bias" question in another response to you....

It's an interesting topic and I'd enjoy discussing it w/you sometime.  Give me a call.  Gary Crum[/INST]

    Let’s see if I understand this; Berkowitz announces a $14M surplus then he rails against Proposition 8 because it would constrain his ability to confiscate even more money from citizens. Berkowitz and his allies on the Assembly changed the tax cap language to facilitate confiscating greater amounts of citizen’s money. Now why would a mayor who professes fidelity with the taxpayers change the law to enable him to take more money from them? Probably because he plans to take more money from them.  Berkowitz said if Proposition 8 passes “it severely constrains our ability to give out property tax relief.”  So Berkowitz wants the ability to confiscate more of the citizen’s money to provide property relief. How about taking less of that money in the first place?  Let’s hope Proposition 8 passes.[/INST]

Your numbers seem to indicate that our residents, many of whom are at or below the median income, are voting, time after time, against their interests. All I was attempting to posit was that we should try thinking outside of the box to resolve some our problems and we can't do that by electing the same politicians over and over again.

Norwegian Air did this to me last March so I got the privilege of flying with a Spanish company I'd never heard of....old plane, worn out seats, etc. I'd wouldn't't have booked this airline in the first place but wasn't warned of this or else would have rebooked.

    I believe we have reached any reasonable limit of decency in interfering with the private life of our politicians. Are we really so naive to believe that if the PM would have had the intention of doing a favor to an old friend a free helicopter ride was the thing that had him made it.?  It is pure witch hunt and then we are surprised why the best do not show up for public service. Would any of us have his/her own life thrown apart for a bunch of whiners never happy wanting everything without paying for anything. I am paying probably more taxes than I would like but I am happy and proud to live in a country that is protecting the weakest. This is insane we have completely lost a real perspective. This is not the measurement of the success of a politician, if he takes a free helicopter ride. But unfortunately it is much easier to blame someone else than look at yourself and be honest about our shortcomings. Who is without sin throw the first stone[/INST]

    The headline does not correspond with the content in the article and specifically to what Coach Leavitt has to say on the matter.

Headline: Lamar Winston planning to make his first start on defense for Oregon Ducks at Wyoming

Article: Leavitt said he’s not sure if Winston will open the game against the Cowboys. “We have different personnel groups so I don’t know if he’ll start or not, it depends on who goes out there,” he said.

From the article it appears the defense in an ongoing state of competition and we can expect, injuries aside, to see different people inserted as starters based on practice performances.

    Just because in the past people's mental health was disregarded, doesn't mean that it was right. From my experiences and observations, it created a generation of adults who are miserable and unable to deal with their emotions or admit when they are in need of help. There is a reason suicide rates are so high, and if institutions are doing their part to potentially help decrease those numbers, then in my eyes that is a good thing.[/INST]

    All the folks you mention are dead. The Southern Strategy was real and deliberate. The only thing stopping you from Googling it up and reading about it is your intense desire to remain ignorant of facts you don't like. Reagan won every Southern state except Georgia in 1980. Jimmy Carter was Georgia's Favorite Son.

The important thing is that the "Solid South" is now solidly Republican. In spite of your meaningless citation of a dozen dead people, the South has changed little in political and social character, still being the center of black voter discouragement, disenfranchisement, and gerrymandering. Only a few states are "solid" Democratic states, by contrast; the "flyover states" are mostly firmly Republican, and the "rust belt states" are in contention. Southern voters and politician are the same as always except that now they call themselves "Republican". And without the South, Republicans could not win the presidency any more.[/INST]

    One point of note with regards to Australia's minimum wage: Tipping is all but unheard of there.  So those working in restaurants or bars might get a higher "wage" but little to no tips, so their overall wage is comparable.

Obvious restaurants and bars aren't the only ones that pay low wages, but they are one of the big industries paying lower wages here.

Also prices in Australia are quite a bit higher than in Canada.  OECD puts the Purchasing Power Parity comparison at roughly 16% higher, so $17.60 Aussie dollars is more like $15 Canadian dollars from a PPP perspective.[/INST]

    As the Minister of Information and Policy and Strategy advisor to the Hawaiian Kingdom I can state unequivocally and with full authority that the "aquarium industry" is in violation of one of the basic principles of Hawaiian culture, malama aina.

Malama aina has been a traditional socio-cultural practice of Hawaiians and ALL Polynesian peoples for many many thousands of years. Malama aina roughly translates as "nurture and sustain what feeds and provides for us". It means that we must act ethically, sustainably and on a subsistence basis at ALL times whenever we take food or resources from nature,

To do this we take from nature only what we need to sustain ourselves and NOTHING more and we do nothing that might effect the natural balance of all living things.

The "aquarium industry" violates this basic Hawaiian principle because it takes reef fish for monetary profit NOT for subsistence.

    That's an apples and oranges comparison. The carbon tax is not an environmental issue but a political issue. If Canada were to completely stop using carbon, the global impact would be statistically insignificant. Night hunting and wildlife conservation on the other hand is an environmental issue that I am sure if everyone put politics aside, they would come to some sort of bipartisan agreement. It would be nice if these chiefs for once, took responsibility and did their job but it's obvious that their intentions run counter to the rest of the population, including their own.[/INST]

    An old professor once told me "Never mistake ritual for reality." The Church evolved into a community dependent on priests because of its attachment to rituals, some of them weekly. If the Church were to consider that rituals are necessary less frequently -- or not at all -- the idea of a "priest shortage" would have to be revisited. 
The reality of the gospel is attainable by anyone who puts it into practice in their lives. We don't need more priests. We need Catholics who take charge of their faith.[/INST]

    This is an appalling decision in allowing the takeover of a high tech firm by businesses linked to the communist party of China, which has never renounced its' ideological commitment to combat, undermine, and destroy, western capitalism, individual rights, right of ownership, expression of differing opinion, and democratic election.  This is a country that has corrupted and bullied governances in Asia and Africa to exert their sphere of influence.  It is a regime that has brutally oppressed its' own population since assuming power in 1948.  It is a stain on the 6000 year old civilization of China.

One can only wonder whether this decision is linked to the pay for access scandal and recent contributions to the Trudeau Foundation by those affiliated with the communist regime.

We, as a nation, and critical component of western defence and democracy, must prevent this breach of  western security.  Our allies must be outraged.  A thorough investigation of this decision is required.[/INST]

    This is a perfect example of why you will not be talking to anyone but yourself. Lack of comprehension skills. There is no point discussing with you. Doesn't matter what science is cited, you guys say it is bad, pseudo science or irrelevant. There is just no point when you consider youselves smarter than the entire EU Public Health Panel on Biocides and also their Fluoridation Panel. 
Must be nice to be so much smarter than everyone else. Pity your opinion is irrelevant to them. 
Read the letters from the various health authorities in Europe on fluoridation. Don't even try that assertion that the question was loaded. An answer that says fluoridation is not wanted, needed or in some cases not permitted, does not come from a loaded question. Now you know why your opinion is neither wanted, needed (except to laugh at) and considered superfluous. 
Please do not bother answering. We have real matters to take care of, Like kicking Fluoridation out of our community forever.[/INST]

    Another great 'Vicky article'. Love them!
I grew up on a homestead in the Copper River Valley. Now that gets cold! I spent hours outdoors, skating, mushing dogs, getting wood, hunting, you name it. Never froze a single finger or toe or was even uncomfortable. The secret? Ahtna-made moose hide mukluks and mitts. No lie: 50 and 60 below and never got cold once. I put thick wool felt insoles in the mukluks and wore thinner mittens inside the moose-mitts and that did the trick. Hey, it worked for the Ahtna people for thousands of years. And if you want to keep your toes warm indoors all winter get a pair of moosehide moccasin slippers. The hand made ones with beaver fur around the tops.[/INST]

    States rights and white supremacy are not mutually exclusive. The state right that was being defended was the right to enslave black people for fun and profit. Today many states want the right to treat certain members of our nation as 2nd class citizens. For example, men can have what ever kind of healthcare they think they need. Their only limitation is whether or not they can afford the health care they want. Women don't have that right in many states. Another  right that is not the same for all Americans is the right to own guns under the 2nd Amendment. Our white domestic terrorists are allowed to walk around in public armed while black people are killed for the mere suspicion of being armed. The United States are not that united. We clearly don't share the same morality from state to state. The truth is all lives don't matter here. They never have. We will never be united until we make all lives matter.[/INST]

    Only in America can you get 25 likes for admitting you are pathetic. But seriously financial destitution is a pretty common thing in a state where booms and busts happen with great regularity. The weird thing is an occasional bust might not be such a bad thing, If Alaska became the "Land of Milk and Honey"
everyone would want to live here. A huge influx of people would slowly destroy the wilderness that keeps many of us here. But perhaps more importantly with the pressures bust's produce comes innovation and a role up your sleeves attitude which often leads to prosperity of the soul if not the pocketbook. The pathetic thing is when people get too comfortable they get lazy and complacent. This can happen to individuals and even to the things humans create like pipelines, legislative bodies or permanent funds. We live in chaotic times but we might end up better for it with some time out to think.[/INST]

    Alaska currently pays out more and takes less in from oil companies than any time in it's history.  Huge cuts in the oil production tax, not declining oil prices are responsible for the bulk of the deficit.  A fact that very few people understand. If the oil and gas industry paid its fair share the deficit would be 50-75% solved.  A modest progressive income tax would be all we need to fill the gap.  Protect the PFD.  As ownership state shareholders, it's the people's return on their investment that keeps us connected to our great land.[/INST]

If Trump wants to totally reinvent the world political and economic order, I think he owes the American public some specific plans and proposed policies. Having "lots of meetings", and telling everyone what a great negotiator he is, is not a plan. The USA is already a great nation with great influence in the world, and we need to honor our long term alliances and commitments, or risk losing much financial and political power and influence. For Pete's sake, we owe these countries trillions of dollars of our national debit. What happens if they ask for their money back?

During all of these discussions about the budget crisis in Alaska, Walker and the legislature have allowed the oil companies to go unaudited.  

The few audits that were completed should have brought the state $488 Million but the state is not bothering to collect on it.

Having a lot of experience with atheists during my studies in university, and having read works by atheists such as Richard Dawkins, I have never met a single atheist who did not attest that they formulated their atheistic beliefs in relation to their knowledge of science and the scientific method.  When an atheists maintains their position is rational, they mean that they believe their atheistic beliefs are in accord with our contemporary scientific understanding of the universe.  This is hardly a straw man claim and evidence is in abundance.  Find any book written by an atheist that does not tie their beliefs to science and the scientific method.  So, Ariel, is the challenge not then to you to find any evidence to disprove what I state is a clear and undeniable linkage between atheism and contemporary science and methodology?  I could give you a definition of the scientific method if you really want it, but I respect that you have a firm knowledge of this system already.not toxic

I enjoy your columns a great deal Ms. Moore.  Insanely, enough, I agree with Richard, and it's a bit all over the place.  Regarding loving one's neighbor, however, again I fear you promote a tepid and materialistic perspective of Christian teachings.  The Bible says "God is with us."  Materialists think it means, "God is on our side" (as we fix the world).   It really means, "God is present."      

Jesus was very clear that his kingdom is not of this world until he makes it so.  Christianity is for us, for our inner peace, guidance and direct experience of spirituality.  Through this inner connection we will know the best actions to take when we need to take them - read Paul again.   

Christianity isn't so Christians can "fix" the rest of the world through political organizing, even though that's what a lot of Christians believe. If we truly want to love our enemies, we have to be willing to let the world go exactly as he did.not toxic

If anyone has a legitimate question, they are shouted down and called "racist"  "denier" "misogynist" "econut"  "leftard" or whatever and not met with rational discourse or rhetorical debate.

    Paul: Thank you for your kind words.  I do, indeed, have strong beliefs and don't hide them.  They are based on both facts and values.  I think the question of "bias" and "prejudice" comes into play when we're discussing beliefs and attitudes based on values.  One of our poster friends,  for example, often comments that being "intolerant" of a bias, for example, is, in itself, a bias.  This is, IMO, where the concept of "irratonal antipathy" is important.  If I dislike neo-Nazis because of their views on race, my antipathy is based on fact (knowledge of their views) and values (my belief that condemning others because of their race/religion is WRONG).  Were I to, instead, dislike all Germans, that, IMO, would represent a bias...an irrational antipathy...since not all Germans condemn others because of their race/religion.  I discuss the "bias" question in another response to you....

It's an interesting topic and I'd enjoy discussing it w/you sometime.  Give me a call.  Gary Crum[/INST]

Facts are completely ignored in your thinking, aren't they? The facts.

The Federal Reserve Act was passed in December 1913 and signed by Woodrow Wilson, a democrat. It was passed in the house by a vote of 298 to 60 and in the senate by a vote of 43 to 25. Almost every democrat was in favor of the bill and most republicans opposed the bill. There were three competing versions of the idea with one coming from the republicans called the Aldrich plan. The final bill had some of Aldrich's features but most were from two competing democrat plans. Especially the idea that the Fed be completely controlled by the government. A democratic idea, not republican. The Federal Reserve System was a republican invention? Not hardly. History proves otherwise. There were republican ideas in the final bill but the main bill was and is largely democratic. Maybe we could agree to call it bipartisan with the main tenets of the bill being democratic.not toxic

No reflection against you, Mitchak, because I agree with you in principle.  Just a general rant - "Now if only all people would be reasonable ..."  So, a state income tax would seem to be reasonable?  Along with a sales tax?  And a luxury tax?  An increase in the gas tax?  Eliminating the tax credits?  Taxing the Oilies on the gross, instead of the net?  Cutting 8,000 top and middle management government/U of A jobs?  Eliminating the travel associated with scholastic sports?  No LIO in Spenard, just back to the old fashioned working out of a spare bedroom when not in session?  Table the gas-line for now?  No more "roads/bridges-to-nowhere"?  And etc. and etc.?  Everyone needs to shoulder the burden equally, right?

I see that most everyone's idea of "reasonable" is whatever it takes, just as long as their ox isn't the one getting gored.  Their "reasonable" is what got us into this mess, and it is what is keeping us in this mess, and it is why we never have nice things for very long.not toxic
No new income tax, no raiding the PFD or CBR, no increasing oil taxes until our state government cuts the entire state budget across the board to reflect the state budget of 2006 when oil averaged $80 a barrel. What changes in population, infrastructure or anything else could justify the increase we have seen in state spending of the last ten years. If we followed our state governments logic if oil had reached $200 a barrel the budget today would be in the neighborhood of twelve billion dollars and some change, for what? We would still be driving on the same substandard roads, state school testing would still be at the same level, we would still have the same number of poor and malnourished residents with poor healthcare . I would have no problem if we had a reasonable income tax, our PFD did not pay out earnings to state residents and we had equitable oil and gas taxes. I would just like to see some fiscal responsibility from the people we elect when passing budget legislation.not toxic

    Let’s see if I understand this; Berkowitz announces a $14M surplus then he rails against Proposition 8 because it would constrain his ability to confiscate even more money from citizens. Berkowitz and his allies on the Assembly changed the tax cap language to facilitate confiscating greater amounts of citizen’s money. Now why would a mayor who professes fidelity with the taxpayers change the law to enable him to take more money from them? Probably because he plans to take more money from them.  Berkowitz said if Proposition 8 passes “it severely constrains our ability to give out property tax relief.”  So Berkowitz wants the ability to confiscate more of the citizen’s money to provide property relief. How about taking less of that money in the first place?  Let’s hope Proposition 8 passes.[/INST]

What’s astonishing is that Trump is not only denying the substance of the accusation, he’s denying that the accusation was even made. Let this sink in: The president-elect of the United States is insisting that something that was witnessed on national television by more than 66 million people never happened."

What the heck is the rush?
First of all, 16 months to introduce this legislation isn't a rush, you should be asking what's taking so long. It's not a complicated problem no matter what some people say, there are numerous jurisdictions including several US states we can copy from. 

"To legalize it to make it harder for young people to acquire the drug seems counterintuitive. "
Of course it is - that is NOT the purpose. We are NOT legalizing to make it harder to get, we're legalizing because prohibition and criminalization are stupid, inefficient, expensive, unjustifiable policies. 

"This is all about "revenue generation" trumping public safety."
No, it's not, because there's no public safety issue to speak of, and if they were sacrificing it for revenue generation this would have been in place long before the budget instead of afterward. On the contrary, your attempt to label it as nothing more than revenue generation is not only wrong but partisan fakery to distract from policy.not toxic
Civil discourse has long be absent in Canada, it is nothing new and the left and its allies in the media are just as guilty. The G&M has an almost daily opinion piece that is hurtful to "whites" and would be considered hate speech if aimed at any other segment in society. This hurtful language is bound to stir up extremists on the right. If anyone has a legitimate question, they are shouted down and called "racist"  "denier" "misogynist" "econut"  "leftard" or whatever and not met with rational discourse or rhetorical debate.
Just because I may have  questions regarding the effectiveness and economic cost of the carbon tax does not mean I should be called a "denier" and told to sit down and shut up.
The more the left tells people to sit down and shut up, the more it feeds the extremists.

No reflection against you, Mitchak, because I agree with you in principle.  Just a general rant - "Now if only all people would be reasonable ..."  So, a state income tax would seem to be reasonable?  Along with a sales tax?  And a luxury tax?  An increase in the gas tax?  Eliminating the tax credits?  Taxing the Oilies on the gross, instead of the net?  Cutting 8,000 top and middle management government/U of A jobs?  Eliminating the travel associated with scholastic sports?  No LIO in Spenard, just back to the old fashioned working out of a spare bedroom when not in session?  Table the gas-line for now?  No more "roads/bridges-to-nowhere"?  And etc. and etc.?  Everyone needs to shoulder the burden equally, right?

I see that most everyone's idea of "reasonable" is whatever it takes, just as long as their ox isn't the one getting gored.  Their "reasonable" is what got us into this mess, and it is what is keeping us in this mess, and it is why we never have nice things for very long.not toxic

PRESIDENT Trump received a lot of support NOT because of media cheerleading and so-called nationalism. The fake “news” media hate Trump and will do all in their power to use lies and distortions to bring him down. As for nationalism, that is far too narrow an explanation. People both at home and abroad suddenly realized we have a patriot in the White House who does not invent fake “red lines” and act like a braggart while doing nothing to back up all his big talk. Unlike his predecessor, Trump is a REAL executive and for him action talks and BS walks.

"A rally planned Thursday in Iowa was postponed due to “an unforeseen change” in Trump’s schedule."....Didn't he just get into office this past January? ... and he starting to campaign? the man is very insecure.
"After maintaining a limited social media presence throughout his trip, Trump unleashed a furious flurry of tweets today, lashing out at what he called the “fake news” media. He focused heavily on leaks — both those coming out of the White House and an intelligence leak blamed on Americans about this week’s deadly bombing at a concert in England."
What! fake news coming from the WH? Is he the source of the WH leaks?
Still trying to figure out the problem with leaking the name of the Manchester bombing. It was a name compared to Israeli intelligence info.

First of all, no company likes to lose orders, no matter the size.  Second, I think you fail to see that this is far more than money, this is about relationships and branding. Canadian is known worldwide, to be America's closest partner, so the world is watching our business relations closely to learn what to expect in their own relations.  In playing along with Washington's current protectionist attitude towards trade, Boeing has shown the world (esp. NATO members) that they may not be the best partner for future procurement projects and that they may be moving more of their production home (America first) in the near future. As such, they could have seriously damaged their brand and their global bottom line long term.  Airbus and European military aircraft manufacturers have a great opportunity and should seize it now.not toxic
Siemens is sick and tired of Canadian politicians interfering in their rail business.

Canada needs to stop the influx of refugees, look after the interests of Canadians first and cooperate with the United States of America and its president.  It is in our own best interests to ensure that Canada does not become a haven for terrorists and a springboard for terrorist attacks on the United States.

If the professional protesters feel that we should have open borders and let in hundreds of thousands of un-vetted 'migrants' and 'refugees', let them go to live in the Muslim world for a while so that they can get a better understanding of why we need better-defended borders and more restrictive immigration policies.

Are we really so naive to believe that if the PM would have had the intention of doing a favor to an old friend a free helicopter ride was the thing that had him made it.?  It is pure witch hunt and then we are surprised why the best do not show up for public service. Would any of us have his/her own life thrown apart for a bunch of whiners never happy wanting everything without paying for anything. I am paying probably more taxes than I would like but I am happy and proud to live in a country that is protecting the weakest. This is insane we have completely lost a real perspective. This is not the measurement of the success of a politician, if he takes a free helicopter ride.

Jesus was very clear that his kingdom is not of this world until he makes it so.  Christianity is for us, for our inner peace, guidance and direct experience of spirituality.  Through this inner connection we will know the best actions to take when we need to take them - read Paul again.

"A rally planned Thursday in Iowa was postponed due to “an unforeseen change” in Trump’s schedule."....Didn't he just get into office this past January? ... and he starting to campaign? the man is very insecure.
"After maintaining a limited social media presence throughout his trip, Trump unleashed a furious flurry of tweets today, lashing out at what he called the “fake news” media. He focused heavily on leaks — both those coming out of the White House and an intelligence leak blamed on Americans about this week’s deadly bombing at a concert in England."
What! fake news coming from the WH? Is he the source of the WH leaks?
Still trying to figure out the problem with leaking the name of the Manchester bombing. It was a name compared to Israeli intelligence info.

    The headline does not correspond with the content in the article and specifically to what Coach Leavitt has to say on the matter.

Headline: Lamar Winston planning to make his first start on defense for Oregon Ducks at Wyoming

Article: Leavitt said he’s not sure if Winston will open the game against the Cowboys. “We have different personnel groups so I don’t know if he’ll start or not, it depends on who goes out there,” he said.

From the article it appears the defense in an ongoing state of competition and we can expect, injuries aside, to see different people inserted as starters based on practice performances.

Mr. Wright, sometimes the "ivory tower" intellectual lacks practical experience.

I received a few months ago a pamphlet from a (no doubt) wise, learned and good intentioned professor advising me on the best way to raise baby chicks (I've been in the business all my life).  I dutifully read the pamphlet and ended up annoyed.

He gave advice on heating the barns (I respectfully submit I know more about my barns than the gentleman) - some the way I do things, some the way I don't for various reasons.  Some not unreasonable advice on feed and water.

The good doctor also made some downright screwy suggestions like checking the rectal temperature of a representative sample of 20 - 50 chicks per floor per day - a pointless waste of time not to mention an undesirable way to spend it.

I couldn't help but get the image (fairly or unfairly) of a veterinarian puttering around a small flock in a laboratory extrapolating his observations mistaken about their practical import elsewhere.not toxic

Civil discourse has long be absent in Canada, it is nothing new and the left and its allies in the media are just as guilty. The G&M has an almost daily opinion piece that is hurtful to "whites" and would be considered hate speech if aimed at any other segment in society. This hurtful language is bound to stir up extremists on the right. If anyone has a legitimate question, they are shouted down and called "racist"  "denier" "misogynist" "econut"  "leftard" or whatever and not met with rational discourse or rhetorical debate.
Just because I may have  questions regarding the effectiveness and economic cost of the carbon tax does not mean I should be called a "denier" and told to sit down and shut up.

No reflection against you, Mitchak, because I agree with you in principle.  Just a general rant - "Now if only all people would be reasonable ..."  So, a state income tax would seem to be reasonable?  Along with a sales tax?  And a luxury tax?  An increase in the gas tax?  Eliminating the tax credits?  Taxing the Oilies on the gross, instead of the net?  Cutting 8,000 top and middle management government/U of A jobs?  Eliminating the travel associated with scholastic sports?  No LIO in Spenard, just back to the old fashioned working out of a spare bedroom when not in session?  Table the gas-line for now?  No more "roads/bridges-to-nowhere"?  And etc. and etc.?  Everyone needs to shoulder the burden equally, right?

I see that most everyone's idea of "reasonable" is whatever it takes, just as long as their ox isn't the one getting gored.  Their "reasonable" is what got us into this mess, and it is what is keeping us in this mess, and it is why we never have nice things for very long.not toxic
No new income tax, no raiding the PFD or CBR, no increasing oil taxes until our state government cuts the entire state budget across the board to reflect the state budget of 2006 when oil averaged $80 a barrel.

For the most part I agree with Bob. I'll go one step further and add that an income tax should be considered only after the permanent fund dividend is stopped. Taxing income earners in order to pay a dividend is an abusive form of socialism.

Why blame gas/oil on every mistake?  When you get a hold of some cash...here comes over spending again. Just like our Native Corp...the price of Zinc has been $1.00+ a pound for a year which is high compared to the usual .55 cents for ten years. And yet shareholders received another letter blaming the price of zinc. I'm happy Don Young was successful in passing the bill to allow all Native Viet Nam vets a chance to apply for land. Now if someone can slow down the mine until proceeds reaches the needy the state would save more than the taxes it takes from the mine. NO NANA DIVIDENDS THIS YEAR!

No reflection against you, Mitchak, because I agree with you in principle.  Just a general rant - "Now if only all people would be reasonable ..."  So, a state income tax would seem to be reasonable?  Along with a sales tax?  And a luxury tax?  An increase in the gas tax?  Eliminating the tax credits?  Taxing the Oilies on the gross, instead of the net?  Cutting 8,000 top and middle management government/U of A jobs?  Eliminating the travel associated with scholastic sports?  No LIO in Spenard, just back to the old fashioned working out of a spare bedroom when not in session?  Table the gas-line for now?  No more "roads/bridges-to-nowhere"?  And etc. and etc.?  Everyone needs to shoulder the burden equally, right?

I see that most everyone's idea of "reasonable" is whatever it takes, just as long as their ox isn't the one getting gored.  Their "reasonable" is what got us into this mess, and it is what is keeping us in this mess, and it is why we never have nice things for very long.not toxic

Mr. Wright, sometimes the "ivory tower" intellectual lacks practical experience.

I received a few months ago a pamphlet from a (no doubt) wise, learned and good intentioned professor advising me on the best way to raise baby chicks (I've been in the business all my life).  I dutifully read the pamphlet and ended up annoyed.

He gave advice on heating the barns (I respectfully submit I know more about my barns than the gentleman) - some the way I do things, some the way I don't for various reasons.  Some not unreasonable advice on feed and water.

The good doctor also made some downright screwy suggestions like checking the rectal temperature of a representative sample of 20 - 50 chicks per floor per day - a pointless waste of time not to mention an undesirable way to spend it.

First of all, no company likes to lose orders, no matter the size.  Second, I think you fail to see that this is far more than money, this is about relationships and branding. Canadian is known worldwide, to be America's closest partner, so the world is watching our business relations closely to learn what to expect in their own relations.  In playing along with Washington's current protectionist attitude towards trade, Boeing has shown the world (esp. NATO members) that they may not be the best partner for future procurement projects and that they may be moving more of their production home (America first) in the near future. As such, they could have seriously damaged their brand and their global bottom line long term.

    All the folks you mention are dead. The Southern Strategy was real and deliberate. The only thing stopping you from Googling it up and reading about it is your intense desire to remain ignorant of facts you don't like. Reagan won every Southern state except Georgia in 1980. Jimmy Carter was Georgia's Favorite Son.

The important thing is that the "Solid South" is now solidly Republican. In spite of your meaningless citation of a dozen dead people, the South has changed little in political and social character, still being the center of black voter discouragement, disenfranchisement, and gerrymandering. Only a few states are "solid" Democratic states, by contrast; the "flyover states" are mostly firmly Republican, and the "rust belt states" are in contention. Southern voters and politician are the same as always except that now they call themselves "Republican". And without the South, Republicans could not win the presidency any more.[/INST]

No new income tax, no raiding the PFD or CBR, no increasing oil taxes until our state government cuts the entire state budget across the board to reflect the state budget of 2006 when oil averaged $80 a barrel.

If we followed our state governments logic if oil had reached $200 a barrel the budget today would be in the neighborhood of twelve billion dollars and some change, for what?

    As the Minister of Information and Policy and Strategy advisor to the Hawaiian Kingdom I can state unequivocally and with full authority that the "aquarium industry" is in violation of one of the basic principles of Hawaiian culture, malama aina.

Malama aina has been a traditional socio-cultural practice of Hawaiians and ALL Polynesian peoples for many many thousands of years. Malama aina roughly translates as "nurture and sustain what feeds and provides for us". It means that we must act ethically, sustainably and on a subsistence basis at ALL times whenever we take food or resources from nature,

To do this we take from nature only what we need to sustain ourselves and NOTHING more and we do nothing that might effect the natural balance of all living things.

The "aquarium industry" violates this basic Hawaiian principle because it takes reef fish for monetary profit NOT for subsistence.

If anyone has a legitimate question, they are shouted down and called "racist"  "denier" "misogynist" "econut"  "leftard" or whatever and not met with rational discourse or rhetorical debate.
Just because I may have  questions regarding the effectiveness and economic cost of the carbon tax does not mean I should be called a "denier" and told to sit down and shut up.
The more the left tells people to sit down and shut up, the more it feeds the extremists.
If 5 people hold a rally against a pipeline our media falls over itself trying to mainstream the protesters, though they represent an extreme view. The lesson to the right is "be extreme" or be ignorednot toxic

No reflection against you, Mitchak, because I agree with you in principle.  Just a general rant - "Now if only all people would be reasonable ..."  So, a state income tax would seem to be reasonable?  Along with a sales tax?  And a luxury tax?  An increase in the gas tax?  Eliminating the tax credits?  Taxing the Oilies on the gross, instead of the net?  Cutting 8,000 top and middle management government/U of A jobs?  Eliminating the travel associated with scholastic sports?  No LIO in Spenard, just back to the old fashioned working out of a spare bedroom when not in session?  Table the gas-line for now?  No more "roads/bridges-to-nowhere"?  And etc. and etc.?  Everyone needs to shoulder the burden equally, right?

I see that most everyone's idea of "reasonable" is whatever it takes, just as long as their ox isn't the one getting gored.  Their "reasonable" is what got us into this mess, and it is what is keeping us in this mess, and it is why we never have nice things for very long.not toxic

    That's an apples and oranges comparison. The carbon tax is not an environmental issue but a political issue. If Canada were to completely stop using carbon, the global impact would be statistically insignificant. Night hunting and wildlife conservation on the other hand is an environmental issue that I am sure if everyone put politics aside, they would come to some sort of bipartisan agreement. It would be nice if these chiefs for once, took responsibility and did their job but it's obvious that their intentions run counter to the rest of the population, including their own.[/INST]

I enjoy your columns a great deal Ms. Moore.  Insanely, enough, I agree with Richard, and it's a bit all over the place.  Regarding loving one's neighbor, however, again I fear you promote a tepid and materialistic perspective of Christian teachings.  The Bible says "God is with us."  Materialists think it means, "God is on our side" (as we fix the world).   It really means, "God is present."      

Jesus was very clear that his kingdom is not of this world until he makes it so.  Christianity is for us, for our inner peace, guidance and direct experience of spirituality.  Through this inner connection we will know the best actions to take when we need to take them - read Paul again.   

Christianity isn't so Christians can "fix" the rest of the world through political organizing, even though that's what a lot of Christians believe. If we truly want to love our enemies, we have to be willing to let the world go exactly as he did.not toxic

    An old professor once told me "Never mistake ritual for reality." The Church evolved into a community dependent on priests because of its attachment to rituals, some of them weekly. If the Church were to consider that rituals are necessary less frequently -- or not at all -- the idea of a "priest shortage" would have to be revisited. 
The reality of the gospel is attainable by anyone who puts it into practice in their lives. We don't need more priests. We need Catholics who take charge of their faith.[/INST]

    This is an appalling decision in allowing the takeover of a high tech firm by businesses linked to the communist party of China, which has never renounced its' ideological commitment to combat, undermine, and destroy, western capitalism, individual rights, right of ownership, expression of differing opinion, and democratic election.  This is a country that has corrupted and bullied governances in Asia and Africa to exert their sphere of influence.  It is a regime that has brutally oppressed its' own population since assuming power in 1948.  It is a stain on the 6000 year old civilization of China.

One can only wonder whether this decision is linked to the pay for access scandal and recent contributions to the Trudeau Foundation by those affiliated with the communist regime.

An answer that says fluoridation is not wanted, needed or in some cases not permitted, does not come from a loaded question.

Kenneth Baitsholts - Perhaps you don't realize this, but almost a 1000 years after its founding, England still has no written constitution. Neither does Canada or New Zealand. This does not mean they don't have rules by which they govern that they hold to under most circumstances, but that -- for whatever reason -- they don't see a reason to write them down in a single document. They spread their governance rules out through acts of Parliament, etc.

Don't get me wrong. I think constitutions are a good thing, but it's really not a good argument against Israel, that they don't have a single written constitution. They have a operative one based on their Declaration of Establishment.

    States rights and white supremacy are not mutually exclusive. The state right that was being defended was the right to enslave black people for fun and profit. Today many states want the right to treat certain members of our nation as 2nd class citizens. For example, men can have what ever kind of healthcare they think they need. Their only limitation is whether or not they can afford the health care they want. Women don't have that right in many states. Another  right that is not the same for all Americans is the right to own guns under the 2nd Amendment. Our white domestic terrorists are allowed to walk around in public armed while black people are killed for the mere suspicion of being armed. The United States are not that united. We clearly don't share the same morality from state to state. The truth is all lives don't matter here. They never have. We will never be united until we make all lives matter.[/INST]

No reflection against you, Mitchak, because I agree with you in principle.  Just a general rant - "Now if only all people would be reasonable ..."

Taxing the Oilies on the gross, instead of the net?  Cutting 8,000 top and middle management government/U of A jobs?  Eliminating the travel associated with scholastic sports?

I see that most everyone's idea of "reasonable" is whatever it takes, just as long as their ox isn't the one getting gored.  Their "reasonable" is what got us into this mess, and it is what is keeping us in this mess, and it is why we never have nice things for very long.not toxic

The weird thing is an occasional bust might not be such a bad thing, If Alaska became the "Land of Milk and Honey"
everyone would want to live here. A huge influx of people would slowly destroy the wilderness that keeps many of us here. But perhaps more importantly with the pressures bust's produce comes innovation and a role up your sleeves attitude which often leads to prosperity of the soul if not the pocketbook. The pathetic thing is when people get too comfortable they get lazy and complacent. This can happen to individuals and even to the things humans create like pipelines, legislative bodies or permanent funds. We live in chaotic times but we might end up better for it with some time out to think.[/INST]

During all of these discussions about the budget crisis in Alaska, Walker and the legislature have allowed the oil companies to go unaudited.

For the most part I agree with Bob. I'll go one step further and add that an income tax should be considered only after the permanent fund dividend is stopped. Taxing income earners in order to pay a dividend is an abusive form of socialism. The permanent fund should be used to subsidize the state and pay welfare to the portion of the state that lives in poverty. Paying a dividend to people who don't need it while taxing their income is perverse.not toxic
I'll agree it isn't a fact until it's pumping ~ thank you for catching my overstatement.  Let's say 75% chance because Armstrong, Caelus and Conoco-Phillips have all predicted having oil in the pipeline in those years.

It appears that you have not really looked at the numbers, which is something I've been doing since I decided I should research this so that I could document it.

    Alaska currently pays out more and takes less in from oil companies than any time in it's history.  Huge cuts in the oil production tax, not declining oil prices are responsible for the bulk of the deficit.  A fact that very few people understand. If the oil and gas industry paid its fair share the deficit would be 50-75% solved.  A modest progressive income tax would be all we need to fill the gap.  Protect the PFD.  As ownership state shareholders, it's the people's return on their investment that keeps us connected to our great land.[/INST]

First of all, no company likes to lose orders, no matter the size.  Second, I think you fail to see that this is far more than money, this is about relationships and branding. Canadian is known worldwide, to be America's closest partner, so the world is watching our business relations closely to learn what to expect in their own relations.  In playing along with Washington's current protectionist attitude towards trade, Boeing has shown the world (esp. NATO members) that they may not be the best partner for future procurement projects and that they may be moving more of their production home (America first) in the near future. As such, they could have seriously damaged their brand and their global bottom line long term.

Civil discourse has long be absent in Canada, it is nothing new and the left and its allies in the media are just as guilty. The G&M has an almost daily opinion piece that is hurtful to "whites" and would be considered hate speech if aimed at any other segment in society. This hurtful language is bound to stir up extremists on the right. If anyone has a legitimate question, they are shouted down and called "racist"  "denier" "misogynist" "econut"  "leftard" or whatever and not met with rational discourse or rhetorical debate.
Just because I may have  questions regarding the effectiveness and economic cost of the carbon tax does not mean I should be called a "denier" and told to sit down and shut up.

I enjoy your columns a great deal Ms. Moore.  Insanely, enough, I agree with Richard, and it's a bit all over the place.  Regarding loving one's neighbor, however, again I fear you promote a tepid and materialistic perspective of Christian teachings.  The Bible says "God is with us."  Materialists think it means, "God is on our side" (as we fix the world).   It really means, "God is present."      

Jesus was very clear that his kingdom is not of this world until he makes it so.  Christianity is for us, for our inner peace, guidance and direct experience of spirituality.  Through this inner connection we will know the best actions to take when we need to take them - read Paul again.

Oh the humanity! #triggerwarning! I thought twitter was a #safespace! Let's kill Canadian jobs for a climate deal that has the backing of Robert Mugabe - Paris is just oozing with credibility: absolutely zero enforcement mechanisms or penalties for non-compliance but like everything the Liberals subscribe to, it's the symbolism that counts #it's2017. Paris was an excuse for tyrants to refresh their wardrobes with the latest European fashions; it was nothing more than a photo-op for the self-titled "progressive" elite who fly around the world in private jets believing they are above flushing the toilet. The David Suzuki Foundation supports Trudeau's new environmental assessment regulations - just a ringing endorsement for industry. Petronas, Shell, Total - multinationals are running for the hills in favor of American and Australian jurisdictions  where their projects aren't paralyzed from career activists and political ignorance.

PRESIDENT Trump received a lot of support NOT because of media cheerleading and so-called nationalism. The fake “news” media hate Trump and will do all in their power to use lies and distortions to bring him down. As for nationalism, that is far too narrow an explanation. People both at home and abroad suddenly realized we have a patriot in the White House who does not invent fake “red lines” and act like a braggart while doing nothing to back up all his big talk. Unlike his predecessor, Trump is a REAL executive and for him action talks and BS walks.

"A rally planned Thursday in Iowa was postponed due to “an unforeseen change” in Trump’s schedule."....Didn't he just get into office this past January? ... and he starting to campaign? the man is very insecure.
"After maintaining a limited social media presence throughout his trip, Trump unleashed a furious flurry of tweets today, lashing out at what he called the “fake news” media. He focused heavily on leaks — both those coming out of the White House and an intelligence leak blamed on Americans about this week’s deadly bombing at a concert in England."
What! fake news coming from the WH? Is he the source of the WH leaks?
Still trying to figure out the problem with leaking the name of the Manchester bombing. It was a name compared to Israeli intelligence info.

    Paul: Thank you for your kind words.  I do, indeed, have strong beliefs and don't hide them.  They are based on both facts and values.  I think the question of "bias" and "prejudice" comes into play when we're discussing beliefs and attitudes based on values.  One of our poster friends,  for example, often comments that being "intolerant" of a bias, for example, is, in itself, a bias.  This is, IMO, where the concept of "irratonal antipathy" is important.  If I dislike neo-Nazis because of their views on race, my antipathy is based on fact (knowledge of their views) and values (my belief that condemning others because of their race/religion is WRONG).  Were I to, instead, dislike all Germans, that, IMO, would represent a bias...an irrational antipathy...since not all Germans condemn others because of their race/religion.  I discuss the "bias" question in another response to you....

It's an interesting topic and I'd enjoy discussing it w/you sometime.  Give me a call.  Gary Crum[/INST]

    Let’s see if I understand this; Berkowitz announces a $14M surplus then he rails against Proposition 8 because it would constrain his ability to confiscate even more money from citizens. Berkowitz and his allies on the Assembly changed the tax cap language to facilitate confiscating greater amounts of citizen’s money. Now why would a mayor who professes fidelity with the taxpayers change the law to enable him to take more money from them? Probably because he plans to take more money from them.  Berkowitz said if Proposition 8 passes “it severely constrains our ability to give out property tax relief.”  So Berkowitz wants the ability to confiscate more of the citizen’s money to provide property relief. How about taking less of that money in the first place?  Let’s hope Proposition 8 passes.[/INST]

Are we really so naive to believe that if the PM would have had the intention of doing a favor to an old friend a free helicopter ride was the thing that had him made it.?  It is pure witch hunt and then we are surprised why the best do not show up for public service. Would any of us have his/her own life thrown apart for a bunch of whiners never happy wanting everything without paying for anything. I am paying probably more taxes than I would like but I am happy and proud to live in a country that is protecting the weakest. This is insane we have completely lost a real perspective.

Headline: Lamar Winston planning to make his first start on defense for Oregon Ducks at Wyoming

Article: Leavitt said he’s not sure if Winston will open the game against the Cowboys. “We have different personnel groups so I don’t know if he’ll start or not, it depends on who goes out there,” he said.

From the article it appears the defense in an ongoing state of competition and we can expect, injuries aside, to see different people inserted as starters based on practice performances.

GO DUCKS![/INST]

    Just because in the past people's mental health was disregarded, doesn't mean that it was right. From my experiences and observations, it created a generation of adults who are miserable and unable to deal with their emotions or admit when they are in need of help.

    All the folks you mention are dead. The Southern Strategy was real and deliberate. The only thing stopping you from Googling it up and reading about it is your intense desire to remain ignorant of facts you don't like. Reagan won every Southern state except Georgia in 1980. Jimmy Carter was Georgia's Favorite Son.

The important thing is that the "Solid South" is now solidly Republican. In spite of your meaningless citation of a dozen dead people, the South has changed little in political and social character, still being the center of black voter discouragement, disenfranchisement, and gerrymandering. Only a few states are "solid" Democratic states, by contrast; the "flyover states" are mostly firmly Republican, and the "rust belt states" are in contention. Southern voters and politician are the same as always except that now they call themselves "Republican". And without the South, Republicans could not win the presidency any more.[/INST]

    One point of note with regards to Australia's minimum wage: Tipping is all but unheard of there.  So those working in restaurants or bars might get a higher "wage" but little to no tips, so their overall wage is comparable.

Obvious restaurants and bars aren't the only ones that pay low wages, but they are one of the big industries paying lower wages here.

Also prices in Australia are quite a bit higher than in Canada.  OECD puts the Purchasing Power Parity comparison at roughly 16% higher, so $17.60 Aussie dollars is more like $15 Canadian dollars from a PPP perspective.[/INST]

    As the Minister of Information and Policy and Strategy advisor to the Hawaiian Kingdom I can state unequivocally and with full authority that the "aquarium industry" is in violation of one of the basic principles of Hawaiian culture, malama aina.

Malama aina has been a traditional socio-cultural practice of Hawaiians and ALL Polynesian peoples for many many thousands of years. Malama aina roughly translates as "nurture and sustain what feeds and provides for us". It means that we must act ethically, sustainably and on a subsistence basis at ALL times whenever we take food or resources from nature,

To do this we take from nature only what we need to sustain ourselves and NOTHING more and we do nothing that might effect the natural balance of all living things.

The "aquarium industry" violates this basic Hawaiian principle because it takes reef fish for monetary profit NOT for subsistence.

    That's an apples and oranges comparison. The carbon tax is not an environmental issue but a political issue. If Canada were to completely stop using carbon, the global impact would be statistically insignificant. Night hunting and wildlife conservation on the other hand is an environmental issue that I am sure if everyone put politics aside, they would come to some sort of bipartisan agreement. It would be nice if these chiefs for once, took responsibility and did their job but it's obvious that their intentions run counter to the rest of the population, including their own.[/INST]

    An old professor once told me "Never mistake ritual for reality." The Church evolved into a community dependent on priests because of its attachment to rituals, some of them weekly. If the Church were to consider that rituals are necessary less frequently -- or not at all -- the idea of a "priest shortage" would have to be revisited. 
The reality of the gospel is attainable by anyone who puts it into practice in their lives. We don't need more priests. We need Catholics who take charge of their faith.[/INST]

    This is an appalling decision in allowing the takeover of a high tech firm by businesses linked to the communist party of China, which has never renounced its' ideological commitment to combat, undermine, and destroy, western capitalism, individual rights, right of ownership, expression of differing opinion, and democratic election.  This is a country that has corrupted and bullied governances in Asia and Africa to exert their sphere of influence.  It is a regime that has brutally oppressed its' own population since assuming power in 1948.  It is a stain on the 6000 year old civilization of China.

One can only wonder whether this decision is linked to the pay for access scandal and recent contributions to the Trudeau Foundation by those affiliated with the communist regime.

We, as a nation, and critical component of western defence and democracy, must prevent this breach of  western security.  Our allies must be outraged.  A thorough investigation of this decision is required.[/INST]

    This is a perfect example of why you will not be talking to anyone but yourself. Lack of comprehension skills. There is no point discussing with you. Doesn't matter what science is cited, you guys say it is bad, pseudo science or irrelevant. There is just no point when you consider youselves smarter than the entire EU Public Health Panel on Biocides and also their Fluoridation Panel. 
Must be nice to be so much smarter than everyone else. Pity your opinion is irrelevant to them. 
Read the letters from the various health authorities in Europe on fluoridation. Don't even try that assertion that the question was loaded. An answer that says fluoridation is not wanted, needed or in some cases not permitted, does not come from a loaded question. Now you know why your opinion is neither wanted, needed (except to laugh at) and considered superfluous. 
Please do not bother answering. We have real matters to take care of, Like kicking Fluoridation out of our community forever.[/INST]

    Another great 'Vicky article'. Love them!
I grew up on a homestead in the Copper River Valley. Now that gets cold! I spent hours outdoors, skating, mushing dogs, getting wood, hunting, you name it. Never froze a single finger or toe or was even uncomfortable. The secret? Ahtna-made moose hide mukluks and mitts. No lie: 50 and 60 below and never got cold once. I put thick wool felt insoles in the mukluks and wore thinner mittens inside the moose-mitts and that did the trick. Hey, it worked for the Ahtna people for thousands of years. And if you want to keep your toes warm indoors all winter get a pair of moosehide moccasin slippers. The hand made ones with beaver fur around the tops.[/INST]

    States rights and white supremacy are not mutually exclusive. The state right that was being defended was the right to enslave black people for fun and profit. Today many states want the right to treat certain members of our nation as 2nd class citizens. For example, men can have what ever kind of healthcare they think they need. Their only limitation is whether or not they can afford the health care they want. Women don't have that right in many states. Another  right that is not the same for all Americans is the right to own guns under the 2nd Amendment. Our white domestic terrorists are allowed to walk around in public armed while black people are killed for the mere suspicion of being armed. The United States are not that united. We clearly don't share the same morality from state to state. The truth is all lives don't matter here. They never have. We will never be united until we make all lives matter.[/INST]

    Only in America can you get 25 likes for admitting you are pathetic. But seriously financial destitution is a pretty common thing in a state where booms and busts happen with great regularity. The weird thing is an occasional bust might not be such a bad thing, If Alaska became the "Land of Milk and Honey"
everyone would want to live here. A huge influx of people would slowly destroy the wilderness that keeps many of us here. But perhaps more importantly with the pressures bust's produce comes innovation and a role up your sleeves attitude which often leads to prosperity of the soul if not the pocketbook. The pathetic thing is when people get too comfortable they get lazy and complacent. This can happen to individuals and even to the things humans create like pipelines, legislative bodies or permanent funds. We live in chaotic times but we might end up better for it with some time out to think.[/INST]

    Alaska currently pays out more and takes less in from oil companies than any time in it's history.  Huge cuts in the oil production tax, not declining oil prices are responsible for the bulk of the deficit.  A fact that very few people understand. If the oil and gas industry paid its fair share the deficit would be 50-75% solved.  A modest progressive income tax would be all we need to fill the gap.  Protect the PFD.
