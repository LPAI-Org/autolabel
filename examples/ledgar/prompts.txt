(i) The Company shall maintain in effect, during the Term and for a period of at least six (6) years following the Term, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance covering Executive and his Legal Representatives (as defined below), with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as that provided under the Company’s policies as of immediately following the Closing.  Such insurance shall be obtained from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s insurance carrier, with respect to such policies, as of immediately following the Closing. The Company shall indemnify Executive and Executive’s beneficiaries and successors (the “Legal Representatives”) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all costs, charges, damages, amounts paid in settlement or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) whatsoever incurred or sustained by Executive or Executive’s Legal Representatives in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding to which Executive or Executive’s Legal Representatives may be made a party as a result of the entering into of this Agreement or the performance of services hereunder. This indemnification provision is in addition to, and is not in substitution for, any other indemnification rights that Executive might have under any insurance policy, the Company’s governance documents, or any other plan, policy or agreement which provides indemnification rights for Executive; provided, however, that any indemnity payments made pursuant to this Section (o) shall not be duplicative of payments made pursuant to any insurance policy, the Company’s governance documents, or any other plan, policy or agreement which provides indemnification rights for Executive.Indemnifications
Borrower shall pay, indemnify, defend, and hold the Agent-Related Persons, the Lender-Related Persons, and each Participant (each, an " Indemnified Person ") harmless (to the fullest extent permitted by law) from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, investigations, proceedings, liabilities, fines, costs, penalties, and damages, and all reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys', experts, or consultants and all other costs and expenses actually incurred in connection therewith or in connection with the enforcement of this indemnification (as and when they are incurred and irrespective of whether suit is brought), at any time asserted against, imposed upon, or incurred by any of them (a) in connection with or as a result of or related to the execution and delivery (provided that Borrower shall not be liable for costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) of any Lender (other than Wells Fargo) incurred in advising, structuring, drafting, reviewing, administering or syndicating the Loan Documents), enforcement, performance, or administration (including any restructuring or workout with respect hereto) of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the monitoring of Parent's and its Subsidiaries' compliance with the terms of the Loan Documents (provided, that the indemnification in this clause (a) shall not extend to (i) disputes solely between or among the Lenders, (ii) disputes solely between or among the Lenders and their respective Affiliates; it being understood and agreed that the indemnification in this clause (a) shall extend to Agent (but not the Lenders) relative to disputes between or among Agent on the one hand, and one or more Lenders, or one or more of their Affiliates, on the other hand, or (iii) any Taxes or any costs attributable to Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 16 ), (b) with respect to any investigation, litigation, or proceeding related to this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or the use of the proceeds of the credit provided hereunder (irrespective of whether any Indemnified Person is a party thereto), or any act, omission, event, or circumstance in any manner related thereto, and (c) in connection with or arising out of any presence or release of Hazardous Materials at, on, under, to or from any assets or properties owned, leased or operated by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any Environmental Actions, Environmental Liabilities or Remedial Actions related in any way to any such assets or properties of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (each and all of the foregoing, the " Indemnified Liabilities "). The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, Borrower shall have no obligation to any Indemnified Person under this Section 10.3 with respect to any Indemnified Liability that a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person or its officers, directors, employees, attorneys', or agents. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the repayment in full of the Obligations. If any Indemnified Person makes any payment to any other Indemnified Person with respect to an Indemnified Liability as to which Borrower was required to indemnify the Indemnified Person receiving such payment, the Indemnified Person making such payment is entitled to be indemnified and reimbursed by Borrower with respect thereto. SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 10.3 , THE FOREGOING INDEMNITY SHALL APPLY TO EACH INDEMNIFIED PERSON WITH RESPECT TO INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES WHICH IN WHOLE OR IN PART ARE CAUSED BY OR ARISE OUT OF ANY NEGLIGENT ACT OR OMISSION OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED PERSON OR OF ANY OTHER PERSON.Indemnifications
(a) Each Lender severally agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by a Borrower), from and against such Lender’s Ratable Share of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as such, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as such, under this Agreement, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, as finally determined in a nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for its Ratable Share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by a Borrower.Indemnifications
Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall maintain their respective existence as a corporation and all of its privileges, franchises, agreements, qualifications and rights that are necessary or desirable in the ordinary course of business; and Borrower shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to maintain and preserve their respective good standing with all Tribunals.Existence

Such Purchaser is not required to obtain any consent, authorization or order of, or make any filing or registration with, any court or governmental agency in order for it to execute, deliver or perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or perform under the other Transaction Documents nor to purchase the Securities in accordance with the terms hereof, provided that for purposes of the representation made in this sentence, such Purchaser is assuming and relying upon the accuracy of the relevant representations and agreements of the Company herein.No Conflicts

The Company shall deduct from all cash distributions under the Plan all taxes required to be withheld by the applicable jurisdiction. Whenever the Company proposes or is required to issue or transfer shares of Stock under the Plan or upon the vesting of any Stock Award, the Company has the right to require the recipient to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy the taxes required to be withheld by the applicable jurisdiction prior to, or as a condition of the issuance of such shares or the vesting of such Stock Award. A Participant may pay the tax withholding obligation in cash (including to the extent not prohibited by the applicable Award Agreement, by having a broker sell shares of Stock subject to the Award on the Participant’s behalf and remitting the cash proceeds to the Company), or, if the applicable Award Agreement or Award Program provides, a Participant may be permitted, or may be required, to have the tax withholding arising from exercise or payment of the Award satisfied by having the number of shares of Stock the Participant is to receive reduced by, or with respect to a Stock Award, by tendering back to the Company, a number of whole shares of Stock which, when multiplied by the Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock, is sufficient to satisfy the tax withholding obligation (after taking into account any withholding in cash required because only whole shares of Stock can be withheld or tendered), at tax withholding rates determined by the Company to be required, or in the Company’s sole discretion, permitted, but not in excess of the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdiction.Withholdings
The Participant agrees to remit to the Company any foreign, Federal, state and/or local taxes (including the Participant’s FICA tax obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to the issuance of Shares under this Award, the vesting of this Award or the payment of cash under this Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Award, if the Company or any Affiliate of the Company is required to withhold any Federal, state or local taxes or other amounts in connection with the Award, then the Company may require the Participant to pay to the Company, in cash, promptly on demand, amounts sufficient to satisfy such tax obligations or make other arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment to the Company of the aggregate amount of any such taxes and other amounts. Alternatively, the Company can withhold Shares no longer restricted, or can withhold from cash or property, including cash or Shares under this Award, payable or issuable to the Participant, in the amount needed to satisfy any withholding obligations; provided that, to the extent Shares are withheld to satisfy taxes, the amount to be withheld may not exceed the total maximum statutory tax withholding obligations associated with the transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a Participant who is a Reporting Person, if the payment hereunder is to be made in the form of Shares, then any withholding obligations shall be satisfied by the Company withholding Shares otherwise issuable under this Award unless the Committee approves an alternative method by which the Participant shall pay such withholding taxes.Withholdings

In the case of any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes, the amounts so payable by the applicable Loan Party to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes) an amount equal to the sum which would have been received had no such deduction or withholding been made; provided , however , that no Loan Party shall be required to increase any such amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes except to the extent that any change in applicable law, treaty or governmental rule or regulation after the time such Lender becomes a party to this agreement (a “ Change in Tax Law ”), shall result in an increase in the rate of any deduction, withholding or payment from that in effect at the time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (or designates a new Applicable Lending Office), except to the extent that such Lender (or its assignor, if any) was entitled, at the time of its designation of a new Applicable Lending Office (or assignment), to receive additional amounts from such Loan Party with respect to such Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to this Section 2.21. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be required to increase any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes that are attributable to such Person’s failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) or (f) of this Section 2.21 except as such failure relates to a Change in Tax Law rendering such Person legally unable to comply.[/INST]

In the event of a Change in Control, each Outside Director will fully vest in his or her Awards.Change In Control
As soon as administratively practicable after a Vesting Date, or, if vesting occurs upon a Change of Control as provided in Section 5(e) of the Plan, as soon as administratively practicable on or following such Change of Control, but in all events not later than 2½ months following the vesting of the Award, you shall be paid the portion of the Award that vested on such date.Payments
Following a Change in Control that occurs before the Award becomes fully vested, you will become fully vested in the unvested portion of the Award upon the occurrence of either of the following events, provided such event occurs no later than twenty-four (24) months following the Change in Control (to the extent the Award has not otherwise become fully vested prior to such event): (i) you experience a Termination of Employment by Tyson without Cause or (ii) you resign from your employment on account of Good Reason. The Award will be settled in the same form of consideration received by shareholders of Tyson Foods, Inc.’s Class A common stock in connection with the Change in Control transaction, unless the express terms of the documentation establishing the terms of the Change in Control provide otherwise.Change In Control
The Participant agrees to remit to the Company any foreign, Federal, state and/or local taxes (including the Participant’s FICA tax obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to the issuance of Shares under this Award, the vesting of this Award or the payment of cash under this Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Award, if the Company or any Affiliate of the Company is required to withhold any Federal, state or local taxes or other amounts in connection with the Award, then the Company may require the Participant to pay to the Company, in cash, promptly on demand, amounts sufficient to satisfy such tax obligations or make other arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment to the Company of the aggregate amount of any such taxes and other amounts. Alternatively, the Company can withhold Shares no longer restricted, or can withhold from cash or property, including cash or Shares under this Award, payable or issuable to the Participant, in the amount needed to satisfy any withholding obligations; provided that, to the extent Shares are withheld to satisfy taxes, the amount to be withheld may not exceed the total maximum statutory tax withholding obligations associated with the transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a Participant who is a Reporting Person, if the payment hereunder is to be made in the form of Shares, then any withholding obligations shall be satisfied by the Company withholding Shares otherwise issuable under this Award unless the Committee approves an alternative method by which the Participant shall pay such withholding taxes.Withholdings
The Company shall deduct from all cash distributions under the Plan all taxes required to be withheld by the applicable jurisdiction. Whenever the Company proposes or is required to issue or transfer shares of Stock under the Plan or upon the vesting of any Stock Award, the Company has the right to require the recipient to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy the taxes required to be withheld by the applicable jurisdiction prior to, or as a condition of the issuance of such shares or the vesting of such Stock Award. A Participant may pay the tax withholding obligation in cash (including to the extent not prohibited by the applicable Award Agreement, by having a broker sell shares of Stock subject to the Award on the Participant’s behalf and remitting the cash proceeds to the Company), or, if the applicable Award Agreement or Award Program provides, a Participant may be permitted, or may be required, to have the tax withholding arising from exercise or payment of the Award satisfied by having the number of shares of Stock the Participant is to receive reduced by, or with respect to a Stock Award, by tendering back to the Company, a number of whole shares of Stock which, when multiplied by the Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock, is sufficient to satisfy the tax withholding obligation (after taking into account any withholding in cash required because only whole shares of Stock can be withheld or tendered), at tax withholding rates determined by the Company to be required, or in the Company’s sole discretion, permitted, but not in excess of the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdiction.Withholdings

If Purchaser is not satisfied with the matters disclosed in the Title Commitment or Survey (including all documents underlying the status of title including, without limitation, any exceptions identified in the Title Commitment and the Survey), then Purchaser shall, if it desires, be entitled to give written notice (the “ Defect Notice ”) to Seller on or before the end of the thirtieth (30th) calendar day from the date the Title Company delivered the Title Commitment to Purchaser of any objectionable matters (the “ Objections ”). If Purchaser fails to timely deliver the Defect Notice, all exceptions (other than the standard printed exceptions committed to be deleted) disclosed in the Title Documents shall become “ Permitted Matters .” If Purchaser delivers a Defect Notice within the time period provided, Seller may elect to: (i) cure or, if applicable and reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, cause the Title Company to insure against or endorse over such Objections at any time prior to Closing or (ii) take no action with regard thereto. Seller shall give Purchaser written notice of Seller’s election within five (5) days after Seller’s receipt of a Defect Notice from Purchaser. Seller’s failure to provide such a notice within five (5) days shall be deemed to be Seller’s notice that it will take no action with respect to any matters which are the subject of Purchaser’s Objections.

Purchaser’s failure to timely elect to waive such Objection(s) in writing shall be deemed Purchaser’s election to terminate.

The Company shall deduct from all cash distributions under the Plan all taxes required to be withheld by the applicable jurisdiction. Whenever the Company proposes or is required to issue or transfer shares of Stock under the Plan or upon the vesting of any Stock Award, the Company has the right to require the recipient to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy the taxes required to be withheld by the applicable jurisdiction prior to, or as a condition of the issuance of such shares or the vesting of such Stock Award. A Participant may pay the tax withholding obligation in cash (including to the extent not prohibited by the applicable Award Agreement, by having a broker sell shares of Stock subject to the Award on the Participant’s behalf and remitting the cash proceeds to the Company), or, if the applicable Award Agreement or Award Program provides, a Participant may be permitted, or may be required, to have the tax withholding arising from exercise or payment of the Award satisfied by having the number of shares of Stock the Participant is to receive reduced by, or with respect to a Stock Award, by tendering back to the Company, a number of whole shares of Stock which, when multiplied by the Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock, is sufficient to satisfy the tax withholding obligation (after taking into account any withholding in cash required because only whole shares of Stock can be withheld or tendered), at tax withholding rates determined by the Company to be required, or in the Company’s sole discretion, permitted, but not in excess of the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdiction.Withholdings
The Participant agrees to remit to the Company any foreign, Federal, state and/or local taxes (including the Participant’s FICA tax obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to the issuance of Shares under this Award, the vesting of this Award or the payment of cash under this Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Award, if the Company or any Affiliate of the Company is required to withhold any Federal, state or local taxes or other amounts in connection with the Award, then the Company may require the Participant to pay to the Company, in cash, promptly on demand, amounts sufficient to satisfy such tax obligations or make other arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment to the Company of the aggregate amount of any such taxes and other amounts. Alternatively, the Company can withhold Shares no longer restricted, or can withhold from cash or property, including cash or Shares under this Award, payable or issuable to the Participant, in the amount needed to satisfy any withholding obligations; provided that, to the extent Shares are withheld to satisfy taxes, the amount to be withheld may not exceed the total maximum statutory tax withholding obligations associated with the transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a Participant who is a Reporting Person, if the payment hereunder is to be made in the form of Shares, then any withholding obligations shall be satisfied by the Company withholding Shares otherwise issuable under this Award unless the Committee approves an alternative method by which the Participant shall pay such withholding taxes.Withholdings

The Company shall deduct from all cash distributions under the Plan all taxes required to be withheld by the applicable jurisdiction. Whenever the Company proposes or is required to issue or transfer shares of Stock under the Plan or upon the vesting of any Stock Award, the Company has the right to require the recipient to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy the taxes required to be withheld by the applicable jurisdiction prior to, or as a condition of the issuance of such shares or the vesting of such Stock Award. A Participant may pay the tax withholding obligation in cash (including to the extent not prohibited by the applicable Award Agreement, by having a broker sell shares of Stock subject to the Award on the Participant’s behalf and remitting the cash proceeds to the Company), or, if the applicable Award Agreement or Award Program provides, a Participant may be permitted, or may be required, to have the tax withholding arising from exercise or payment of the Award satisfied by having the number of shares of Stock the Participant is to receive reduced by, or with respect to a Stock Award, by tendering back to the Company, a number of whole shares of Stock which, when multiplied by the Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock, is sufficient to satisfy the tax withholding obligation (after taking into account any withholding in cash required because only whole shares of Stock can be withheld or tendered), at tax withholding rates determined by the Company to be required, or in the Company’s sole discretion, permitted, but not in excess of the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdiction.Withholdings
The Participant agrees to remit to the Company any foreign, Federal, state and/or local taxes (including the Participant’s FICA tax obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to the issuance of Shares under this Award, the vesting of this Award or the payment of cash under this Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Award, if the Company or any Affiliate of the Company is required to withhold any Federal, state or local taxes or other amounts in connection with the Award, then the Company may require the Participant to pay to the Company, in cash, promptly on demand, amounts sufficient to satisfy such tax obligations or make other arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment to the Company of the aggregate amount of any such taxes and other amounts. Alternatively, the Company can withhold Shares no longer restricted, or can withhold from cash or property, including cash or Shares under this Award, payable or issuable to the Participant, in the amount needed to satisfy any withholding obligations; provided that, to the extent Shares are withheld to satisfy taxes, the amount to be withheld may not exceed the total maximum statutory tax withholding obligations associated with the transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a Participant who is a Reporting Person, if the payment hereunder is to be made in the form of Shares, then any withholding obligations shall be satisfied by the Company withholding Shares otherwise issuable under this Award unless the Committee approves an alternative method by which the Participant shall pay such withholding taxes.Withholdings
